⏺ Based on the Anthropic documentation, here are the key improvements needed for your product-analyst agent:

  🔍 Identified Improvements

  1. Remove Invalid YAML Field

  Current Issue: Line 4 has color: purple which is not a valid field according to the documentation.
  Why it matters: Invalid fields may cause parsing errors or be silently ignored, leading to unexpected behavior.
  Source: Documentation only specifies name, description, and optional tools fields.

  2. Enhance Description with Action-Oriented Language

  Current: "Use this agent to translate business requirements..."
  Improved: Should include proactive triggers like "MUST BE USED when creating new features" or "PROACTIVELY invoked for requirement gathering"
  Why it matters: Claude Code uses the description to determine when to automatically delegate to the sub-agent. More assertive language increases usage.
  Source: Documentation recommends "action-oriented language" and phrases like "PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED".

  3. Specify Tool Restrictions

  Current Issue: No tools field means the agent inherits ALL tools (including Write, Edit, MultiEdit, etc.)
  Recommended: Limit to only necessary tools for requirement gathering
  Why it matters: A product analyst shouldn't need code editing tools - this reduces security risks and focuses the agent's capabilities.
  Source: "Only grant tools necessary for the sub-agent's specific purpose"

  4. Restructure Opening Prompt

  Current: Starts with tool access description
  Improved: Should start with clear role definition
  Why it matters: The documentation emphasizes "Define the sub-agent's role clearly" as the first element.
  Source: Prompt structure recommendations prioritize role definition.

  5. Add Explicit Tool Specification

  Suggested tools field: tools: Read, Glob, Grep, LS, Bash, mcp__filesystem__read_file, mcp__filesystem__write_file, mcp__filesystem__create_directory
  Why: Product analyst needs to:
  - Read existing specifications (Read, mcp__filesystem__read_file)
  - Search for patterns (Glob, Grep)
  - Create .ai folder structure (mcp__filesystem__create_directory)
  - Write specifications (mcp__filesystem__write_file)
  - Check project context (Bash for simple commands)

  6. Streamline Instructions

  Current: Very detailed but somewhat repetitive sections
  Improved: More concise, action-oriented checklist format
  Why it matters: Documentation shows successful agents use clear checklists and step-by-step instructions.

  📋 How These Improvements Will Help

  1. Better Automatic Invocation: Stronger description language will help Claude Code automatically delegate requirement gathering tasks to this agent.
  2. Improved Security: Limiting tools prevents accidental code modifications during requirement gathering.
  3. Clearer Purpose: Restructured prompt makes the agent's role immediately clear, improving its effectiveness.
  4. Reduced Errors: Removing invalid YAML fields ensures proper parsing and behavior.
  5. Focused Capabilities: Tool restrictions keep the agent focused on its core purpose - gathering requirements and creating specifications.

## Session Content

```terminal
  Option 2: Use wildcard syntax

  ---
  name: product-analyst
  description: Your description here
  tools: *
  ---
  The asterisk (*) explicitly grants access to all tools.

  Current Status

  Your current product-analyst.md already gives access to all tools because it doesn't have a tools field in the YAML frontmatter. Lines 1-5 show:
  ---
  name: product-analyst
  description: Use this agent to translate business requirements...
  color: purple  # This field is invalid and should be removed
  ---

  Since there's no tools field, your agent already has access to everything including:
  - All file operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
  - Bash commands
  - Web tools (WebFetch, WebSearch)
  - Task management (TodoWrite)
  - MCP tools (filesystem, fetch, puppeteer, etc.)
  - All other available tools

  Note

  The documentation recommends restricting tools to only what's necessary for security and focus reasons, but if you want the product-analyst to have full capabilities
  (like being able to prototype code while gathering requirements), keeping all tools accessible makes sense.

## Session Content

```terminal
  2. Specific goals (lines 11-15): Well-defined 4-step process
  3. Detailed instructions: Comprehensive sections for gathering requirements
  4. Output template: Clear BDD specification format (lines 65-190)
  5. Context awareness: Good emphasis on reading existing .ai folder

  ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement

  1. Opening Structure

  Current: Starts with tool access description (line 7)
  Better: Should start with role, then explain capabilities
  You are an expert product analyst specializing in BDD specifications.

  Your mission: Transform vague ideas into crystal-clear, implementable feature specifications.

  2. Description Field Enhancement

  Current: "Use this agent to translate business requirements..."
  Should be: More assertive for automatic invocation:
  description: MUST BE USED when planning new features or gathering requirements. This agent proactively analyzes requirements, asks clarifying questions, and generates
  comprehensive BDD specifications with implementation slices. Specializes in breaking features into deployable increments.

  3. Prompt Length & Focus

  Issue: At 244 lines, it's quite verbose with some repetition
  Recommendation: Condense to ~150 lines by:
  - Combining similar sections
  - Using more concise bullet points
  - Removing redundant instructions

  4. Action-Oriented Language

  Current: Passive voice in many places
  Better: Use imperatives and active voice:
  - Change: "Start by asking the user"
  - To: "ASK the user immediately"

  5. Tool Usage Instructions

  Missing: No explicit guidance on when to use specific tools
  Add: Tool usage examples within context:
  When gathering context:
  - Use `Grep` to find existing feature patterns
  - Use `Read` to examine current specifications
  - Use `Write` to save the final BDD spec

  6. Success Criteria

  Missing: No clear "completion checklist"
  Add: Definition of when the agent has succeeded:
  ## Success Criteria
  ✓ All requirement areas explored
  ✓ Edge cases identified
  ✓ Feature sliced into 3+ deployable increments
  ✓ BDD specification saved to .ai/ folder
  ✓ Implementation agent can start immediately

  📊 Overall Assessment

  Your agent is 70% optimal. It has excellent domain knowledge and structure but needs:
  1. More assertive description for auto-invocation
  2. Tighter, more action-oriented prompt
  3. Clearer success metrics
  4. Remove the invalid color field

  🎯 Recommended Structure

                                                                                                                                                                        
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan to Optimize product-analyst.md

     I'll make these improvements to align with Anthropic's best practices:

     1. YAML Frontmatter Updates

     - Remove invalid color: purple field
     - Enhance description with "MUST BE USED" language for better auto-invocation
     - Keep tools unrestricted (no tools field = all tools)

     2. Restructure Prompt Content

     - Move role definition to the very beginning
     - Add clear mission statement upfront
     - Consolidate repetitive sections
     - Add explicit success criteria section

     3. Improve Action-Oriented Language

     - Change passive voice to active imperatives
     - Add tool usage examples in context
     - Make instructions more concise and direct

     4. Optimize Length

     - Reduce from 244 to ~150 lines
     - Keep all critical information
     - Remove redundant instructions
     - Maintain the excellent BDD template

     5. Add Completion Metrics

     - Clear checklist for agent success
     - Explicit handoff criteria to implementation agent
     - Defined quality gates

     These changes will make the agent more likely to be auto-invoked, more focused in execution, and clearer about success criteria while maintaining full tool access.

       196 -    **ALWAYS start by reading existing .ai folder contents to build context:**
       197 -    
       198 -    1. **Check if .ai folder exists and read contents:**
       199 -       ```bash
       200 -       if [ -d ".ai" ]; then
       201 -         echo "Found existing .ai folder. Reading context..."
       202 -         ls -la .ai/
       203 -       else
       204 -         echo "No existing .ai folder found. Starting fresh."
       205 -       fi
       206 -       ```
       207 -    
       208 -    2. **Read existing feature specifications:**
       209 -       ```bash
       210 -       # List all existing feature files
       211 -       find .ai -name "*.md" -type f
       212 -       ```
       213 -       
       214 -       Then use filesystem tools to read each file:
       215 -       ```
       216 -       [Use filesystem tool to read each .md file in .ai/]
       217 -       ```
       218 -    
       219 -    3. **Analyze existing patterns:**
       220 -       - What features already exist?
       221 -       - What naming conventions are used?
       222 -       - What business domains are covered?
       223 -       - Are there dependencies between existing features?
       224 -       - What technical patterns emerge?
       225 -    
       226 -    4. **Build context summary:**
       227 -       Before asking about the new feature, provide a summary:
       228 -       "I found [X] existing features in your .ai folder covering [domains]. I can see patterns around [patterns]. This context will help me ask better 
           - questions about your new feature."
       194 +  # Check project structure  
       195 +  ls -la src/
       196    
       197 -    ## Getting Started
       198 -    
       199 -    **Step 1: Context Building**
       200 -    Always start by reading existing .ai folder to understand the project context.
       201 -    
       202 -    **Step 2: Feature Discovery**
       203 -    Then ask: "What feature or requirement would you like to plan? Please give me a brief description to start."
       204 -    
       205 -    **Step 3: Contextual Planning**
       206 -    Use the existing knowledge to:
       207 -    - Ask more informed questions
       208 -    - Suggest consistent naming patterns
       209 -    - Identify potential dependencies with existing features
       210 -    - Maintain consistency with established patterns
       211 -    
       212 -    Continue the conversation naturally, leveraging existing context to ask better follow-up questions until you have enough information to generate a 
           - comprehensive BDD specification.
       197 +  # Read existing feature
       198 +  cat .ai/feature-login.md

## Session Content

```terminal
  Why it matters: A product analyst shouldn't need code editing tools - this reduces security risks and focuses the agent's capabilities.
  Source: "Only grant tools necessary for the sub-agent's specific purpose"

  4. Restructure Opening Prompt

  Current: Starts with tool access description
  Improved: Should start with clear role definition
  Why it matters: The documentation emphasizes "Define the sub-agent's role clearly" as the first element.
  Source: Prompt structure recommendations prioritize role definition.

  5. Add Explicit Tool Specification

  Suggested tools field: tools: Read, Glob, Grep, LS, Bash, mcp__filesystem__read_file, mcp__filesystem__write_file, mcp__filesystem__create_directory
  Why: Product analyst needs to:
  - Read existing specifications (Read, mcp__filesystem__read_file)
  - Search for patterns (Glob, Grep)
  - Create .ai folder structure (mcp__filesystem__create_directory)
  - Write specifications (mcp__filesystem__write_file)
  - Check project context (Bash for simple commands)

  6. Streamline Instructions

  Current: Very detailed but somewhat repetitive sections
  Improved: More concise, action-oriented checklist format
  Why it matters: Documentation shows successful agents use clear checklists and step-by-step instructions.

  📋 How These Improvements Will Help

  1. Better Automatic Invocation: Stronger description language will help Claude Code automatically delegate requirement gathering tasks to this agent.
  2. Improved Security: Limiting tools prevents accidental code modifications during requirement gathering.
  3. Clearer Purpose: Restructured prompt makes the agent's role immediately clear, improving its effectiveness.
  4. Reduced Errors: Removing invalid YAML fields ensures proper parsing and behavior.
  5. Focused Capabilities: Tool restrictions keep the agent focused on its core purpose - gathering requirements and creating specifications.

> how I an give access to all tools?

⏺ To give a sub-agent access to all tools, you have two options:

  Option 1: Omit the tools field entirely (Recommended)

  ---
  name: product-analyst
  description: Your description here
  ---
  When you don't include a tools field, the sub-agent automatically inherits ALL available tools from the parent Claude Code instance.

  Option 2: Use wildcard syntax

  ---
  name: product-analyst
  description: Your description here
  tools: *
  ---
  The asterisk (*) explicitly grants access to all tools.

  Current Status

  Your current product-analyst.md already gives access to all tools because it doesn't have a tools field in the YAML frontmatter. Lines 1-5 show:
  ---
  name: product-analyst
  description: Use this agent to translate business requirements...
  color: purple  # This field is invalid and should be removed
  ---

  Since there's no tools field, your agent already has access to everything including:
  - All file operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
  - Bash commands
  - Web tools (WebFetch, WebSearch)
  - Task management (TodoWrite)
  - MCP tools (filesystem, fetch, puppeteer, etc.)
  - All other available tools

  Note

  The documentation recommends restricting tools to only what's necessary for security and focus reasons, but if you want the product-analyst to have full capabilities
  (like being able to prototype code while gathering requirements), keeping all tools accessible makes sense.

> lets give access to all tools. The color field must be removed. What about the content of the agent, its clear and match a good prompt for a subagent?

⏺ Looking at your product-analyst agent content against the Anthropic documentation best practices, here's my analysis:

  ✅ Strengths of Current Content

  1. Clear role definition (line 7): "expert product analyst and BDD specialist"
  2. Specific goals (lines 11-15): Well-defined 4-step process
  3. Detailed instructions: Comprehensive sections for gathering requirements
  4. Output template: Clear BDD specification format (lines 65-190)
  5. Context awareness: Good emphasis on reading existing .ai folder

  ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement

  1. Opening Structure

  Current: Starts with tool access description (line 7)
  Better: Should start with role, then explain capabilities
  You are an expert product analyst specializing in BDD specifications.

  Your mission: Transform vague ideas into crystal-clear, implementable feature specifications.

  2. Description Field Enhancement

  Current: "Use this agent to translate business requirements..."
  Should be: More assertive for automatic invocation:
  description: MUST BE USED when planning new features or gathering requirements. This agent proactively analyzes requirements, asks clarifying questions, and generates
  comprehensive BDD specifications with implementation slices. Specializes in breaking features into deployable increments.

  3. Prompt Length & Focus

  Issue: At 244 lines, it's quite verbose with some repetition
  Recommendation: Condense to ~150 lines by:
  - Combining similar sections
  - Using more concise bullet points
  - Removing redundant instructions

  4. Action-Oriented Language

  Current: Passive voice in many places
  Better: Use imperatives and active voice:
  - Change: "Start by asking the user"
  - To: "ASK the user immediately"

  5. Tool Usage Instructions

  Missing: No explicit guidance on when to use specific tools
  Add: Tool usage examples within context:
  When gathering context:
  - Use `Grep` to find existing feature patterns
  - Use `Read` to examine current specifications
  - Use `Write` to save the final BDD spec

  6. Success Criteria

  Missing: No clear "completion checklist"
  Add: Definition of when the agent has succeeded:
  ## Success Criteria
  ✓ All requirement areas explored
  ✓ Edge cases identified
  ✓ Feature sliced into 3+ deployable increments
  ✓ BDD specification saved to .ai/ folder
  ✓ Implementation agent can start immediately

  📊 Overall Assessment

  Your agent is 70% optimal. It has excellent domain knowledge and structure but needs:
  1. More assertive description for auto-invocation
  2. Tighter, more action-oriented prompt
  3. Clearer success metrics
  4. Remove the invalid color field

  🎯 Recommended Structure

     - Change passive voice to active imperatives
     - Add tool usage examples in context
     - Make instructions more concise and direct

     4. Optimize Length

     - Reduce from 244 to ~150 lines
     - Keep all critical information
     - Remove redundant instructions
     - Maintain the excellent BDD template

     5. Add Completion Metrics

     - Clear checklist for agent success
     - Explicit handoff criteria to implementation agent
     - Defined quality gates

     These changes will make the agent more likely to be auto-invoked, more focused in execution, and clearer about success criteria while maintaining full tool access.

       193    
       194 -    ## Context Building from Existing Knowledge
       195 -    
       196 -    **ALWAYS start by reading existing .ai folder contents to build context:**
       197 -    
       198 -    1. **Check if .ai folder exists and read contents:**
       199 -       ```bash
       200 -       if [ -d ".ai" ]; then
       201 -         echo "Found existing .ai folder. Reading context..."
       202 -         ls -la .ai/
       203 -       else
       204 -         echo "No existing .ai folder found. Starting fresh."
       205 -       fi
       206 -       ```
       207 -    
       208 -    2. **Read existing feature specifications:**
       209 -       ```bash
       210 -       # List all existing feature files
       211 -       find .ai -name "*.md" -type f
       212 -       ```
       213 -       
       214 -       Then use filesystem tools to read each file:
       215 -       ```
       216 -       [Use filesystem tool to read each .md file in .ai/]
       217 -       ```
       218 -    
       219 -    3. **Analyze existing patterns:**
       220 -       - What features already exist?
       221 -       - What naming conventions are used?
       222 -       - What business domains are covered?
       223 -       - Are there dependencies between existing features?
       224 -       - What technical patterns emerge?
       225 -    
       226 -    4. **Build context summary:**
       227 -       Before asking about the new feature, provide a summary:
       228 -       "I found [X] existing features in your .ai folder covering [domains]. I can see patterns around [patterns]. This context will help me ask better 
           - questions about your new feature."
       194 +  # Check project structure  
       195 +  ls -la src/
       196    
       197 -    ## Getting Started
       198 -    
       199 -    **Step 1: Context Building**
       200 -    Always start by reading existing .ai folder to understand the project context.
       201 -    
       202 -    **Step 2: Feature Discovery**
       203 -    Then ask: "What feature or requirement would you like to plan? Please give me a brief description to start."
       204 -    
       205 -    **Step 3: Contextual Planning**
       206 -    Use the existing knowledge to:
       207 -    - Ask more informed questions
       208 -    - Suggest consistent naming patterns
       209 -    - Identify potential dependencies with existing features
       210 -    - Maintain consistency with established patterns
       211 -    
       212 -    Continue the conversation naturally, leveraging existing context to ask better follow-up questions until you have enough information to generate a 
           - comprehensive BDD specification.

⏺ ✅ Improvements Complete

  I've successfully optimized your product-analyst agent based on Anthropic's documentation. Here's what changed:

  Key Improvements Made:

  1. Fixed YAML - Removed invalid color field, kept full tool access
  2. Enhanced Description - Added "MUST BE USED" language for better auto-invocation
  3. Clearer Structure - Role and mission upfront, reduced from 244 to 211 lines
  4. Action-Oriented - Active voice, imperatives (ASK, USE, CREATE, WRITE)
  5. Success Criteria - Clear completion checklist at the top
  6. Tool Examples - Specific tool usage in context
  7. Quality Gates - Explicit handoff criteria

  Why These Changes Matter:

  - Better Auto-invocation: The assertive description helps Claude Code automatically delegate requirement gathering tasks
  - Clearer Focus: Mission statement and success criteria prevent scope creep
  - Faster Execution: Concise, action-oriented language reduces processing time
  - Higher Quality Output: Quality gates ensure consistent, complete specifications
  - Seamless Handoff: Clear completion criteria enable smooth transition to implementation

  The agent now follows Anthropic's best practices while maintaining full tool access for maximum flexibility during requirement gathering and specification creation.
