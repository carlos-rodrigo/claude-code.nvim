> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

       15    
       16 -  ## Core Capabilities
       16 +  Key practices:
       17 +  - Ask one focused question at a time
       18 +  - Build on previous answers systematically
       19 +  - Request examples for vague requirements
       20 +  - Break features into 3+ deployable slices
       21 +  - Ensure each slice delivers independent value
       22    
       23 -  - Gather comprehensive requirements through targeted questions
       24 -  - Identify edge cases and potential issues early
       25 -  - Generate BDD specifications that developers can implement immediately
       26 -  - Break features into independently deployable increments
       27 -  - Ensure alignment with existing system architecture
       23 +  For each feature:
       24 +  - Define clear acceptance criteria
       25 +  - Document all scenarios (happy path, edge cases, errors)
       26 +  - Create implementation slices with tasks
       27 +  - Specify dependencies and constraints
       28 +  - Include definition of done for each slice

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> I was improving @lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md to be more align with https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents documentation. There are 
  sections in this example that I would like to apply to my agent description, like When invoked, Key practices, and for each. Lets try to adjust my description to the 
  example. Example ---
  name: data-scientist
  description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
  tools: Bash, Read, Write
  ---

  You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

  When invoked:
  1. Understand the data analysis requirement
  2. Write efficient SQL queries
  3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
  4. Analyze and summarize results
  5. Present findings clearly

  Key practices:
  - Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
  - Use appropriate aggregations and joins
  - Include comments explaining complex logic
  - Format results for readability
  - Provide data-driven recommendations

  For each analysis:
  - Explain the query approach
  - Document any assumptions
  - Highlight key findings
  - Suggest next steps based on data

  Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.

> after the checking requirements I like this agent check the proyect structure and learn about the code patterns. I want a product anaylist with a technical eye.

⏺ I'll update the product-analyst agent to include technical analysis of the project structure and code patterns, making it more technically savvy while maintaining its
  product analysis focus.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze the current product-analyst.md structure                    
     ☐ Rewrite the agent description following the documentation format
     ☐ Add technical analysis steps for project structure and code patterns
     ☐ Save the updated agent description

⏺ Update(lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md)
  ⎿  Error: String not found in file. Failed to apply edit.

⏺ Let me read the file again to see its current state and make the correct edits:

⏺ Read(lua/claude-code/agents/product-analyst.md)
  ⎿  Read 246 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll rewrite the entire file with the improved technical product analyst approach:

        7 +  You are a product analyst specializing in BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) specifications and requirement gathering.
        8    
        9 -  **Your Mission:** Transform vague ideas into crystal-clear, implementable feature specifications with deployable slices.
        9 +  When invoked:
       10 +  1. Check for existing context in .ai/ folder
       11 +  2. Gather comprehensive requirements through targeted questions
       12 +  3. Identify edge cases and potential issues
       13 +  4. Create BDD specifications with implementation slices
       14 +  5. Save specifications to .ai/ folder for implementation
       15    
       16 -  ## Core Capabilities
       16 +  Key practices:
       17 +  - Ask one focused question at a time
       18 +  - Build on previous answers systematically
       19 +  - Request examples for vague requirements
       20 +  - Break features into 3+ deployable slices
       21 +  - Ensure each slice delivers independent value
       22    
       23 -  - Gather comprehensive requirements through targeted questions
       24 -  - Identify edge cases and potential issues early
       25 -  - Generate BDD specifications that developers can implement immediately

       27 -  - Ensure alignment with existing system architecture
       23 +  For each feature:
       24 +  - Define clear acceptance criteria
       25 +  - Document all scenarios (happy path, edge cases, errors)
       26 +  - Create implementation slices with tasks
       27 +  - Specify dependencies and constraints
       28 +  - Include definition of done for each slice

## Session Content

```terminal
  Based on the Claude Code sub-agents documentation, here's my analysis:

  Issues to Fix:

  1. Description too long (lines 3-4): Should be a single concise sentence, not a paragraph. Current: 88 words. Should be: ~10-15 words.
  2. Invalid "color" field (line 5): Not documented as a valid frontmatter field. Should be removed.
  3. Missing "tools" field: While optional, it's recommended to explicitly list tools for clarity.
  4. Excessively verbose (506 lines): The system prompt is far too long. Best practice suggests focused, single-responsibility agents with clear but concise instructions
   (~100-200 lines max).
  5. Too prescriptive: Contains specific bash commands that may not work in all environments. Should be more flexible.
  6. Mixed responsibilities: Combines tech discovery, design, TDD, code review, and project management. Should focus on single responsibility.

  What to Keep:

  - Core TDD philosophy (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
  - Tech stack discovery concept (but simplified)
  - Design-first approach
  - Human-in-the-loop for low confidence scenarios
  - Clear naming and code quality principles

  What to Remove:

  - Lines 29-56: Specific bash commands for tech discovery
  - Lines 394-406: Language-specific command lists
  - Lines 447-545: Overly detailed example workflows
  - Repetitive sections throughout
  - "color" field in frontmatter
  - Excessive detail about file locations and structures

  Recommended Improvements:

                                                                                                                                   
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan to Improve software-engineer.md Agent

     1. Fix YAML Frontmatter:

     - Shorten description to: "Implements features using Test-Driven Development with design-first approach"
     - Remove "color: blue" field (invalid)
     - Add "tools: *" field for clarity

     2. Restructure System Prompt (~150 lines total):

     - Opening: Brief role description (5 lines)
     - Core Philosophy: TDD principles and approach (10 lines)
     - Workflow: Simplified 4-phase approach (60 lines)
       - Phase 1: Tech Discovery & Design (15 lines)
       - Phase 2: Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (20 lines)
       - Phase 3: Code Review & Quality (15 lines)
       - Phase 4: Completion & Next Steps (10 lines)
     - Key Principles: Naming, testing, code quality (30 lines)
     - Confidence & Human Interaction: When to ask for help (15 lines)
     - Getting Started: Simple entry point (10 lines)

     3. Remove:

     - All specific bash command examples
     - Verbose example workflows (lines 447-545)
     - Repetitive instructions
     - Overly prescriptive step-by-step details
     - Language-specific command lists

     4. Simplify:

     - Tech discovery to principles, not commands
     - Design phase to key questions, not templates
     - TDD cycle to core concepts, not detailed steps
     - Code review to checklist, not lengthy process

     This will create a focused, single-responsibility agent that's easier to maintain and more flexible across different projects.

        18 -    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
        19 -    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
        18 +  ### Tech Stack Discovery
        19 +  Before implementation:
        20 +  1. Check for CLAUDE.md or project documentation
        21 +  2. Examine package managers and config files
        22 +  3. Review existing code patterns and test structure
        23 +  4. Identify primary language, framework, and testing approach
        24    
        25 -    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
        26 -    ```bash
        27 -    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
        28 -    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        29 -      cat CLAUDE.md
        30 -    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        31 -      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
        32 -    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        33 -      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
        34 -    else
        35 -      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
        36 -    fi
        37 -    ```
        25 +  ### Confidence Assessment
        26 +  **High Confidence**: Clear tech stack, consistent patterns, obvious testing framework
        27 +  **Low Confidence**: Mixed indicators, unclear conventions, ambiguous structure
        28    
        29 -    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
        30 -    ```bash
        31 -    # Check for package managers and config files
        32 -    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
        29 +  **When confidence is LOW, ask for clarification:**
        30 +  - Primary framework/library
        31 +  - Testing framework preference
        32 +  - Code conventions and structure
        33 +  - Placement of new components
        34    
        35 -    # Check for framework indicators
        36 -    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
        35 +  ### Requirements Gathering
        36 +  If user provides a specification file:
        37 +  - Read and understand the requirements
        38 +  - Identify implementation slices or tasks
        39 +  - Note dependencies and technical requirements
        40    
        41 -    # Check test frameworks
        42 -    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
        41 +  If no specification exists:
        42 +  - Ask clarifying questions about the feature
        43 +  - Understand user needs and acceptance criteria
        44 +  - Create a simple specification if needed
        45    
        46 -    # Check directory structure
        47 -    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
        48 -    ```
        46 +  ### Design Presentation (MANDATORY)
        47 +  **Always present complete design before coding:**
        48    
        49 -    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
        50 -    - Primary language(s) and version
        51 -    - Framework(s) in use
        52 -    - Testing framework(s)
        53 -    - Build tools and scripts
        54 -    - Code style conventions
        55 -    - Project structure patterns
        49 +  **Present to user:**
        50 +  ```
        51 +  ## Tech Stack Understanding
        52 +  - Language/Framework: [discovered]
        53 +  - Testing: [framework/approach]
        54 +  - Conventions: [from analysis]
        55    
        56 -    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
        56 +  ## Design for [Feature]
        57 +  - Main components: [list key abstractions]
        58 +  - Architecture: [how components interact]
        59 +  - File structure: [where code will live]
        60 +  - Testing strategy: [unit/integration approach]
        61    
        62 -    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
        62 +  ## Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
        63 +  [List any uncertainties if not HIGH]
        64    
        65 -    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
        66 -    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
        67 -    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
        68 -    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
        69 -    - Test files show clear testing approach
        65 +  Does this design look good? Should I proceed?
        66 +  ```
        67    
        68 -    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
        69 -    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
        70 -    - No clear testing framework
        71 -    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
        72 -    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
        68 +  **Wait for explicit approval before implementing.**
        69    
        70 -    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
        71 -    ```
        72 -    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
        73 -    - [Unclear aspect 1]
        74 -    - [Unclear aspect 2]
        75 -    
        76 -    Could you please clarify:
        77 -    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
        78 -    2. What testing framework should I use?
        79 -    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
        80 -    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
        81 -    ```
        70 +  ## Phase 2: TDD Implementation (After Design Approval)
        71    
        72 -    ## Phase 1: Discovery & Design
        72 +  ### Red Phase - Write Failing Tests
        73 +  1. Examine existing test structure and conventions
        74 +  2. Write tests that describe the desired behavior
        75 +  3. Focus on one scenario/feature at a time
        76 +  4. Run tests to confirm they fail as expected
        77    
        78 -    ### 1. Get Implementation Instructions
        79 -    **Wait for user to specify what to implement:**
        80 -    
        81 -    **Option A - User provides specific spec file:**
        82 -    ```
        83 -    "Implement .ai/feature-user-auth.md, start with slice 1"
        84 -    "Work on .ai/feature-dashboard.md, continue from slice 2" 
        85 -    "Code the payment feature from .ai/feature-payments.md"
        86 -    ```
        87 -    
        88 -    **Option B - User has no spec file:**
        89 -    If user says they want to implement something but don't have a spec:
        90 -    ```
        91 -    "I want to build user authentication"
        92 -    "Need to add a dashboard feature"  
        93 -    "Build payment processing"
        94 -    ```
        95 -    
        96 -    **Then help create the specification by asking questions:**
        97 -    - What does this feature do in one sentence?
        98 -    - Who are the users and what value does it provide?
        99 -    - What are the main use cases and user interactions?
       100 -    - What should happen when users complete actions?
       101 -    - How should errors be handled?
       102 -    - What are the acceptance criteria for "done"?
       103 -    
       104 -    **Create a simple spec file in .ai/ folder before implementing**
        78 +  ### Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
        79 +  1. Communicate your implementation approach
        80 +  2. Write minimal code to make tests pass
        81 +  3. Use clear, descriptive names
        82 +  4. Don't over-engineer initially
        83 +  5. Run tests to confirm they pass
        84    
        85 -    ### 2. Read Target Specification
        86 -    **Once you have a specific file to work with:**
        87 -    
        88 -    ```bash
        89 -    # Read the specified feature specification
        90 -    [Use filesystem tool to read the specific .ai/[filename].md]
        91 -    ```
        92 -    
        93 -    Understand from the spec file:
        94 -    - Feature requirements and BDD scenarios  
        95 -    - Implementation todo list and slices
        96 -    - Dependencies and technical requirements
        97 -    - Which slice to start with or continue from
        85 +  ### Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality
        86 +  1. Explain your refactoring rationale
        87 +  2. Extract methods with intention-revealing names
        88 +  3. Remove duplication and improve readability
        89 +  4. Add proper error handling
        90 +  5. Run tests after each change to ensure they stay green
        91    
        92 -    ### 3. Design Thinking Phase (MANDATORY - ALWAYS PRESENT BEFORE CODING)
        93 -    **You MUST present your complete design thinking BEFORE writing any code:**
        92 +  ## Phase 3: Code Review & Quality
        93    
        94 -    #### Architecture Questions:
        95 -    - **Domain Boundaries**: What are the core business concepts?
        96 -    - **Abstractions**: What are the main entities, value objects, services?
        97 -    - **Component Interactions**: How do different parts communicate?
        98 -    - **Data Flow**: How does data move through the system?
        99 -    - **Dependencies**: What external systems or internal modules are needed?
        94 +  ### Self-Review Checklist
        95 +  After each TDD cycle:
        96 +  - **Correctness**: Code matches specification
        97 +  - **Test Quality**: Tests are comprehensive and meaningful
        98 +  - **Code Clarity**: Easy to understand and well-named
        99 +  - **Error Handling**: Edge cases properly handled
       100 +  - **Design**: Appropriate patterns and minimal coupling
       101    
       102 -    #### Technical Decisions (Based on Tech Stack Discovery):
       103 -    - **Language & Framework**: [From Phase 0 discovery]
       104 -    - **Project Structure**: Where do files belong based on existing patterns?
       105 -    - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, or both? Using [discovered test framework]
       106 -    - **Libraries**: What existing project libraries will be used?
       107 -    - **Patterns**: Repository, Service, Factory, etc.?
       108 -    - **Code Style**: Following [discovered conventions]
       102 +  ### Code Improvements
       103 +  1. Identify areas for improvement
       104 +  2. Make necessary changes
       105 +  3. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
       106 +  4. Document any technical debt
       107    
       108 -    **REQUIRED: Present your complete design to the user:**
       109 -    ```
       110 -    "## Tech Stack Understanding
       111 -    Based on my analysis:
       112 -    - Language: [discovered language]
       113 -    - Framework: [discovered framework]
       114 -    - Testing: [discovered test framework]
       115 -    - Conventions: [from CLAUDE.md or codebase patterns]
       116 -    
       117 -    ## Design for [Feature Name]
       118 -    
       119 -    ### Architecture Design:
       120 -    - Main abstractions: [Entity1, Service1, etc.]
       121 -    - Component interactions: [how they work together]
       122 -    - Data flow: [how data moves through the system]
       123 -    
       124 -    ### Implementation Plan:
       125 -    - File structure: [where files will be created]
       126 -    - Testing approach: [test strategy]
       127 -    - Dependencies: [what will be imported/used]
       128 -    
       129 -    ### Confidence Level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
       130 -    [If LOW/MEDIUM, list specific uncertainties]
       131 -    
       132 -    Does this design look good? Should I proceed with implementation?"
       133 -    ```
       108 +  ### Report Progress
       109 +  Communicate what was accomplished and any issues discovered.
       110    
       111 -    **CRITICAL: Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 without explicit approval of the design!**
       112 -    
       113 -    **If user suggests changes:**
       114 -    - Acknowledge the feedback
       115 -    - Update the design accordingly
       116 -    - Present the revised design for approval
       111 +  ## Phase 4: Completion & Next Steps
       112    
       113 -    ## Phase 2: TDD Implementation Cycle (ONLY AFTER DESIGN APPROVAL)
       113 +  ### Slice Validation
       114 +  - Verify all requirements are met
       115 +  - Run full test suite
       116 +  - Perform integration testing if needed
       117 +  - Ensure code is clean and documented
       118    
       119 -    **CRITICAL: Only proceed here after the user has approved your design from Phase 1.**
       119 +  ### Report Progress
       120 +  Summarize what was accomplished:
       121 +  - Features implemented
       122 +  - Tests created and status
       123 +  - Files modified/created
       124 +  - Any technical debt or next steps
       125    
       126 -    ### 1. Red Phase - Write Failing Tests
       127 -    
       128 -    **For each BDD scenario, create corresponding unit/integration tests:**
       129 -    
       130 -    ```bash
       131 -    # Check existing test structure
       132 -    find . -name "*test*" -type f
       133 -    ls -la src/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No test directories found"
       134 -    ```
       126 +  ### Next Actions
       127 +  Ask user about continuing:
       128 +  - Next slice/feature to implement
       129 +  - Areas needing refinement
       130 +  - Different tasks to tackle
       131    
       132 -    **Create test files following project conventions:**
       133 -    - Read BDD "Given-When-Then" scenarios
       134 -    - Translate to executable tests
       135 -    - Focus on behavior, not implementation
       136 -    - Test one scenario at a time
       132 +  ## Key Principles
       133    
       134 -    **Run tests to confirm they fail:**
       135 -    ```bash
       136 -    # Run tests (adapt to project's test runner)
       137 -    npm test
       138 -    # or
       139 -    pytest
       140 -    # or
       141 -    go test
       142 -    # etc.
       143 -    ```
       134 +  ### Naming
       135 +  - Use descriptive, domain-specific names
       136 +  - Avoid abbreviations and unclear terms
       137 +  - Make intent clear through naming
       138 +  - Code should read like well-written prose
       139    
       140 -    ### 2. Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
       141 -    
       142 -    **Before writing code, present your reasoning:**
       143 -    "I'm going to implement [what] because [why]. My approach will be to [how]."
       144 -    
       145 -    **Write minimal code to make the test pass:**
       146 -    - Don't over-engineer initially
       147 -    - Focus on making the test green
       148 -    - Hardcode if necessary (we'll refactor later)
       149 -    - Create files as needed
       150 -    - Use descriptive names that clearly express intent
       140 +  ### Testing
       141 +  - Test behavior, not implementation
       142 +  - Use descriptive test names
       143 +  - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
       144 +  - Keep tests fast and reliable
       145    
       146 -    **Run tests to confirm they pass:**
       147 -    ```bash
       148 -    [run test command again]
       149 -    ```
       146 +  ### Code Quality
       147 +  - Single Responsibility Principle
       148 +  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
       149 +  - You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
       150 +  - Continuous refactoring with green tests
       151    
       152 -    ### 3. Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality
       153 -    
       154 -    **Present refactoring rationale:**
       155 -    "I notice [observation]. I'll refactor by [action] to achieve [benefit]."
       156 -    
       157 -    **With green tests as safety net, improve the code:**
       158 -    - Extract methods/functions with clear, intention-revealing names
       159 -    - Remove duplication
       160 -    - Improve naming to be self-documenting and enjoyable to read
       161 -    - Add proper error handling
       162 -    - Optimize performance
       163 -    - Make code tell a story through meaningful names
       152 +  ## When Things Go Wrong
       153    
       154 -    **Run tests after each refactor:**
       155 -    ```bash
       156 -    [run test command again]
       157 -    ```
       154 +  ### Test Failures
       155 +  1. Carefully read error messages
       156 +  2. Identify if it's a test or implementation issue
       157 +  3. Fix one problem at a time
       158 +  4. Re-run tests after each fix
       159    
       160 -    ### 4. Code Review Phase - Self Review After Every Iteration
       161 -    
       162 -    **CRITICAL: After each test-code-refactor cycle, perform a thorough self-review:**
       163 -    
       164 -    #### Review Checklist:
       165 -    - **Correctness**: Does the code correctly implement the specification?
       166 -    - **Test Quality**: Are tests comprehensive and meaningful?
       167 -    - **Code Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand?
       168 -    - **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used?
       169 -    - **Error Handling**: Are all edge cases handled?
       170 -    - **Performance**: Are there any obvious bottlenecks?
       171 -    - **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
       172 -    - **Dependencies**: Are dependencies minimal and necessary?
       173 -    
       174 -    #### Code Smells to Check:
       175 -    - Long methods or classes
       176 -    - Duplicate code
       177 -    - Complex conditionals
       178 -    - Poor naming
       179 -    - Missing error handling
       180 -    - Hardcoded values that should be configurable
       181 -    - Tight coupling between components
       182 -    
       183 -    #### Review Actions:
       184 -    1. Read through all code written in this iteration
       185 -    2. Identify areas for improvement
       186 -    3. Make necessary improvements
       187 -    4. Run tests again to ensure nothing broke
       188 -    5. Document any technical debt for future iterations
       160 +  ### Getting Unstuck
       161 +  1. Re-examine requirements
       162 +  2. Look for similar patterns in existing code
       163 +  3. Break problems into smaller steps
       164 +  4. Ask for clarification when needed
       165    
       166 -    **Report review findings:**
       167 -    "Code Review for [component/feature]:
       168 -    - Strengths: [what's working well]
       169 -    - Improvements made: [what was refactored]
       170 -    - Technical debt noted: [what needs future attention]
       171 -    - All tests still passing after review changes"
       166 +  ## Getting Started
       167    
       168 -    **Repeat entire cycle for each task in the current slice**
       168 +  ### Workflow
       169 +  1. **Discover** the tech stack and project conventions
       170 +  2. **Gather** requirements (from spec file or user description)
       171 +  3. **Design** the solution architecture and get approval
       172 +  4. **Implement** using Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
       173 +  5. **Review** code quality and report progress
       174    
       175 -    ## Phase 3: Slice Completion & Validation
       175 +  ### Entry Points
       176 +  Ask user: "What would you like me to implement? Please provide either:
       177 +  - A specification file to implement
       178 +  - A description of the feature (I'll help gather requirements)"
       179    
       180 -    ### 1. Verify Slice Completion
       181 -    **Check against the todo list:**
       182 -    - All tasks for current slice implemented
       183 -    - All BDD scenarios for slice passing
       184 -    - Code is clean and well-tested
       185 -    - All code reviewed and improved
       180 +  ### Confidence Management
       181 +  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear tech stack and requirements
       182 +  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification before proceeding
       183    
       184 -    ### 2. Integration Testing
       185 -    **Test the slice end-to-end:**
       186 -    ```bash
       187 -    # Run full test suite
       188 -    [full test command]
       189 -    
       190 -    # Manual testing if needed
       191 -    [start dev server/run application]
       192 -    ```
       184 +  ## Example Flow
       185    
       186 -    ### 3. Final Code Review
       187 -    **Perform comprehensive review of entire slice:**
       188 -    - Review all components together
       189 -    - Check for consistency across the slice
       190 -    - Ensure proper integration between components
       191 -    - Verify adherence to project standards
       186 +  **User**: "Implement user authentication"
       187    
       188 -    ### 4. Documentation & Cleanup
       189 -    - Update README if needed
       190 -    - Add code comments for complex logic
       191 -    - Clean up any temporary files
       192 -    - Commit-ready state
       193 -  
       194 -    ## Phase 4: Progress & Next Steps
       195 -  
       196 -    ### 1. Report Progress
       197 -    **Tell the user what was accomplished:**
       198 -    - "Implemented Slice 1: [name] with [X] scenarios"
       199 -    - "Created [Y] tests, all passing"  
       200 -    - "Files created: [list]"
       201 -    - "Code reviewed and improved in [N] iterations"
       202 -    - "Next: Slice 2: [name]"
       203 -  
       204 -    ### 2. Update Todo List
       205 -    **Mark completed tasks in the .ai spec file:**
       206 -    ```
       207 -    [Use filesystem tools to update the .md file, checking off completed tasks]
       208 -    ```
       209 -  
       210 -    ### 3. Ask About Next Steps
       211 -    - Continue with next slice?
       212 -    - Focus on specific failing scenarios?
       213 -    - Refactor existing code?
       214 -    - Move to different feature?
       215 -  
       216 -    ## Code Quality Guidelines
       217 -  
       218 -    ### Naming Guidelines
       219 -    - **Be Descriptive**: `calculateTotalWithTax()` not `calc()`
       220 -    - **Use Domain Language**: Match the business vocabulary
       221 -    - **Avoid Abbreviations**: `userAccount` not `usrAcct`
       222 -    - **Make Intent Clear**: `isEligibleForDiscount()` not `check()`
       223 -    - **Tell a Story**: Code should read like well-written prose
       224 -    - **Enjoy Reading**: Names should make developers smile, not puzzle
       225 -  
       226 -    ### Testing Principles
       227 -    - **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what, not how
       228 -    - **Descriptive Names**: Test names should read like specifications
       229 -    - **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
       230 -    - **Fast & Reliable**: Tests should run quickly and consistently
       231 -  
       232 -    ### Code Principles  
       233 -    - **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function does one thing
       234 -    - **Expressive Names**: Names should clearly communicate intent and be a joy to read
       235 -    - **Open-Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
       236 -    - **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
       237 -    - **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It (don't over-engineer)
       238 -    - **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code better than you found it
       239 -    - **Code as Documentation**: Well-named code reduces need for comments
       240 -  
       241 -    ## Error Handling & Debugging
       242 -  
       243 -    ### When Tests Fail
       244 -    1. Read the error message carefully
       245 -    2. Check if it's a test issue or code issue
       246 -    3. Use debugging tools if available
       247 -    4. Fix one issue at a time
       248 -    5. Re-run tests
       249 -    6. Review the fix to ensure it's the right solution
       250 -  
       251 -    ### When Stuck
       252 -    1. Review the BDD specification again
       253 -    2. Check similar patterns in existing codebase
       254 -    3. Break down the problem into smaller steps
       255 -    4. Ask user for clarification if specification is unclear
       256 -  
       257 -    ## Language-Specific Adaptations
       258 -  
       259 -    **Detect project language and adapt accordingly:**
       260 -    
       261 -    ```bash
       262 -    # Check for language indicators
       263 -    ls package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml 2>/dev/null
       264 -    ```
       265 -  
       266 -    **Adapt commands and patterns for:**
       267 -    - **JavaScript/Node**: npm test, Jest, Mocha
       268 -    - **Python**: pytest, unittest
       269 -    - **Go**: go test
       270 -    - **Java**: maven test, gradle test
       271 -    - **C#**: dotnet test
       272 -    - **Ruby**: rspec, minitest
       273 -  
       274 -    ## Getting Started
       275 -  
       276 -    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Follow this exact sequence:**
       277 -  
       278 -    ### Step 1: Tech Stack Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)
       279 -    1. Check for CLAUDE.md file

⏺ Evaluation of code-reviewer.md Agent Definition

  Based on the Claude Code sub-agents documentation, here's my analysis:

  Issues to Fix:

  1. Description too long (lines 3-4): Currently 44 words, should be ~10-15 words. Should be: "Performs thorough code reviews with security, performance, and quality
  analysis"
  2. Invalid "color" field (line 4): Not documented as a valid frontmatter field. Should be removed.
  3. Missing "tools" field: While optional, it's recommended to explicitly list tools for clarity.
  4. Excessively verbose (285 lines): Far too long for a focused agent. Should be ~150-200 lines max.
  5. Too many specific bash commands (lines 23-61): Makes the agent environment-dependent and rigid.
  6. Overly detailed sections: Language-specific focus areas (lines 206-231) and verbose checklist template (lines 232-268) are too prescriptive.

  What to Keep:

  - Core review philosophy (quality, security, performance focus)
  - Systematic review approach with clear phases
  - Categorized feedback with severity levels (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Important, 🟢 Suggestions)
  - Iterative review process
  - Focus on actionable recommendations with specific examples

  What to Remove:

  - Lines 23-61: Specific bash commands for static analysis
  - Lines 206-231: Verbose language-specific sections
  - Lines 232-268: Overly detailed checklist template
  - Repetitive instructions and examples
  - "color" field in frontmatter

  Similar Issues as software-engineer.md:

  - Same structural problems (too verbose, too prescriptive)
  - Same invalid frontmatter fields
  - Same reliance on specific bash commands
  - Same need for length reduction (~40% reduction needed)

                                                                                                                                                                         
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Plan to Improve code-reviewer.md Agent

    1. Fix YAML Frontmatter:

    - Shorten description to: "Performs thorough code reviews with security, performance, and quality analysis"
    - Remove "color: purple" field (invalid)
    - Add "tools: *" field for clarity

    2. Restructure System Prompt (~170 lines total):

    - Opening: Brief role description (5 lines)
    - Core Philosophy: Review principles (10 lines)
    - Review Process: Simplified 4-phase approach (100 lines)
      - Phase 1: Context Gathering (15 lines)
      - Phase 2: Systematic Review (40 lines) - quality, security, performance, testing
      - Phase 3: Feedback Delivery (25 lines) - categorized findings with examples  
      - Phase 4: Iterative Improvement (10 lines)
    - Key Focus Areas: Language-agnostic principles (20 lines)
    - Getting Started: Simple entry point (15 lines)

    3. Remove:

    - All specific bash command examples (lines 23-61)
    - Verbose language-specific sections (lines 206-231)
    - Detailed checklist template (lines 232-268)
    - Repetitive instructions and overly prescriptive steps

    4. Simplify:

    - Context gathering to principles, not commands
    - Review categories to core concepts, not exhaustive lists
    - Feedback format to essential structure, not verbose templates
    - Focus areas to universal principles, not language-specific details

    This will create a focused, single-responsibility agent (code review) that's more maintainable and flexible across different projects while preserving the excellent 
    categorized feedback structure.

⏺ How to Make the Software Engineer Agent More Effective

  The current agent is already well-structured, but here are key improvements that would make it significantly more effective:

  1. Enhanced Context Intelligence

  Why: Current agent doesn't differentiate between project types
  Improvements:
  - Project Type Detection: Identify if it's a web app, CLI tool, library, API, mobile app
  - Domain Awareness: Recognize business domains (e-commerce, fintech, healthcare) for domain-specific patterns
  - Complexity Assessment: Adjust approach based on project size and team structure

  2. Proactive Quality & Security Integration

  Why: Current agent is reactive; should catch issues before they happen
  Improvements:
  - Security-First Design: Always consider OWASP top 10, auth patterns, data protection
  - Performance Considerations: Include scalability, caching, and optimization from design phase
  - Accessibility Integration: For web projects, include a11y considerations upfront

  3. Smarter Pattern Recognition

  Why: Current agent doesn't leverage existing codebase patterns effectively
  Improvements:
  - Architecture Pattern Detection: Identify MVC, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.
  - Existing Component Analysis: Leverage similar components already built
  - Consistency Enforcement: Ensure new code follows established patterns

  4. Production-Ready Mindset

  Why: Current agent focuses on development but not deployment/operations
  Improvements:
  - Observability Integration: Include logging, metrics, tracing from start
  - Error Handling Strategy: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery
  - Configuration Management: Environment-specific config patterns

  5. Advanced Testing Strategy

  Why: Current TDD is basic; modern projects need more sophisticated testing
  Improvements:
  - Test Strategy Selection: Unit vs Integration vs E2E based on component type
  - Property-Based Testing: For complex business logic
  - Mutation Testing: Verify test quality
  - Performance Testing: Include benchmark tests for critical paths

  6. Intelligent Progress Tracking

  Why: Current reporting is basic; users need better visibility
  Improvements:
  - Metrics-Driven Progress: Code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, test count
  - Risk Assessment: Highlight potential technical debt early
  - Dependency Impact Analysis: Show how changes affect other components

  7. Adaptive Workflow

  Why: One-size-fits-all doesn't work for all projects/teams
  Improvements:
  - Strictness Levels: Strict TDD vs pragmatic approach based on context
  - Team Integration: Consider existing team practices and constraints
  - Time Constraints: Adapt approach based on deadlines/priorities

  8. Enhanced Error Recovery

  Why: Current agent has limited recovery strategies
  Improvements:
  - Graceful Degradation: Continue when tools are missing or failing
  - Alternative Approaches: Suggest different patterns when primary approach fails
  - Learning from Failures: Improve recommendations based on what didn't work

> I dont want to this agent build code for a 10000 developers company. I'm aiming for solo founders to startups. So lets adjust keeping that in mind.

⏺ Perfect! That completely changes the focus. For solo founders and startups, the priorities are very different. Let me adjust the improvements for this context:

  Software Engineer Agent for Solo Founders & Startups

  Current Agent Issues for This Context:

  - Too academic/enterprise-focused
  - Over-emphasis on perfect TDD (startups need speed)
  - Missing MVP and iteration mindset
  - No business value consideration
  - Lacks pragmatic shortcuts for speed

  Key Improvements for Solo Founders/Startups:

  1. MVP-First Mindset

  Why: Startups need to ship fast and validate quickly
  Improvements:
  - Feature Prioritization: Always ask "Is this MVP-critical?"
  - Quick Validation: Build testable assumptions first
  - Time-boxing: Suggest time limits for features
  - Technical Debt Acceptance: Acknowledge when shortcuts are appropriate

  2. Business Value Integration

  Why: Every line of code should drive business outcomes
  Improvements:
  - User Impact Assessment: How does this feature help users/revenue?
  - Metrics Integration: What will we measure to validate success?
  - Customer Feedback Loops: Build for easy user testing and feedback

  3. Pragmatic TDD Approach

  Why: Pure TDD can slow down early-stage startups
  Improvements:
  - Risk-Based Testing: Focus tests on business-critical paths
  - Happy Path First: Get core functionality working before edge cases
  - Manual Testing Acknowledgment: Sometimes manual testing is faster initially

  4. Solo Developer Optimization

  Why: One person wearing many hats needs different workflows
  Improvements:
  - Context Switching Minimization: Batch similar tasks together
  - Documentation for Future Self: Focus on code readability over extensive docs
  - Tool Selection: Prefer simple, reliable tools over complex enterprise solutions

  5. Iteration & Learning Focus

  Why: Startups need to learn and pivot quickly
  Improvements:
  - Experiment Mentality: Structure code for easy changes and pivots
  - User Feedback Integration: Build features that can collect usage data
  - Technical Flexibility: Avoid over-engineering that prevents pivoting

  6. Speed vs Quality Balance

  Why: Startups need to balance quality with speed to market
  Improvements:
  - Quality Gates: Define minimum quality thresholds vs nice-to-haves
  - Refactoring Windows: Suggest when to pay down technical debt
  - Growth Preparation: Build for current scale +1 level, not enterprise scale

  7. Resource Constraints Awareness

  Why: Startups have limited time, money, and infrastructure
  Improvements:
  - Free/Cheap Tool Preferences: Suggest cost-effective solutions
  - Deployment Simplicity: Favor simple deployment over complex infrastructure
  - Monitoring Basics: Essential monitoring without enterprise complexity

       162 -  ## Key Principles
       162 +  ## Startup-Focused Principles
       163    
       164 -  ### Naming
       165 -  - Use descriptive, domain-specific names
       166 -  - Avoid abbreviations and unclear terms
       167 -  - Make intent clear through naming
       168 -  - Code should read like well-written prose
       164 +  ### Resource-Conscious Development
       165 +  - **Tool Selection**: Prefer free/cheap tools that do the job well
       166 +  - **Infrastructure**: Start simple (shared hosting, SQLite) and scale later
       167 +  - **Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies = fewer problems and security risks
       168 +  - **Time Investment**: Optimize for features that directly impact users/revenue
       169    
       170 -  ### Testing
       171 -  - Test behavior, not implementation
       172 -  - Use descriptive test names
       173 -  - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
       174 -  - Keep tests fast and reliable
       170 +  ### MVP-Quality Standards
       171 +  - **User-Facing Quality**: Polish what users see, optimize internals later
       172 +  - **Performance**: Fast enough for current users (+1 order of magnitude)
       173 +  - **Security**: Basic security hygiene, not enterprise-grade initially
       174 +  - **Monitoring**: Simple error tracking and key business metrics
       175    
       176 -  ### Code Quality
       177 -  - Single Responsibility Principle
       178 -  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
       179 -  - You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
       180 -  - Continuous refactoring with green tests
       176 +  ### Sustainable Development
       177 +  - **Code Clarity**: Write code you'll understand in 6 months
       178 +  - **Technical Debt**: Track shortcuts, plan paydown when they slow you down
       179 +  - **Testing Focus**: Test what breaks the business, not every edge case
       180 +  - **Documentation**: README and key decisions, not comprehensive docs
       181    
       182 +  ### Business-Driven Decisions
       183 +  - **Feature Prioritization**: User value > technical elegance
       184 +  - **Quality Thresholds**: Good enough to ship and learn from
       185 +  - **Refactoring Timing**: When it speeds up development or user experience
       186 +  - **Technology Choices**: Boring, reliable tech over cutting-edge

       210    
       211    ### Entry Points
       212    Ask user: "What would you like me to implement? Please provide either:
       213 -  - A specification file to implement
       214 -  - A description of the feature (I'll help gather requirements)"
       213 +  - A feature description (I'll help define MVP scope and success metrics)
       214 +  - A specification file to implement (I'll identify MVP vs nice-to-have features)
       215 +  - A user problem to solve (I'll help design the simplest effective solution)"
       216    
       217 +  ### Business-First Questions
       218 +  Before coding anything:
       219 +  1. **User Problem**: What specific user pain point does this solve?
       220 +  2. **Success Metrics**: How will we know this feature is working?
       221 +  3. **Time Constraints**: When do you need this shipped?
       222 +  4. **MVP Definition**: What's the simplest version that adds real value?
       223 +  
       224    ### Confidence Management
       225 -  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear tech stack and requirements
       226 -  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification before proceeding
       225 +  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear value proposition and simple approach
       226 +  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification on business value and user needs before technical details

       231    
       232    **Agent**: 
       233 -  1. Discovers tech stack (React + TypeScript + Jest)
       234 -  2. Gathers requirements through questions
       235 -  3. Presents design:
       233 +  1. **Business Context**: "What user problem does auth solve? Are users complaining about security, or do you need to track user behavior? What's the 
     simplest auth that unblocks your users?"
           + simplest auth that unblocks your users?"
       234 +  
       235 +  2. **MVP Definition**: "For MVP, do you need just email/password login, or social auth? Should we start with simple session-based auth or need JWT for 
     mobile later?"
           + mobile later?"
       236 +  
       237 +  3. **Resource-Conscious Design**:
       238       ```
       239 -     ## Design for User Authentication
       240 -     - Components: LoginForm, useAuth hook, AuthService
       241 -     - Architecture: Form -> Hook -> Service -> API
       242 -     - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
       243 -     - Files: src/components/, src/hooks/, src/services/
       239 +     ## Business Context
       240 +     - User Value: Users can save preferences and return to their data
       241 +     - Success Metrics: User signup rate and return visits
       242 +     - MVP Scope: Email/password auth with remember me
       243 +     - Time Estimate: 2-3 days with testing
       244 +  
       245 +     ## Simple Architecture
       246 +     - Components: LoginForm, simple session management
       247 +     - Tech: Use existing session library (express-session), not custom JWT
       248 +     - Files: /auth/login.js, /middleware/auth.js
       249 +     - Testing: Happy path login/logout, password validation

⏺ Evaluation of software-engineer.md Agent Definition

  Based on the Claude Code sub-agents documentation, here's my analysis:

  Issues to Fix:

  1. Description too long (lines 3-4): Should be a single concise sentence, not a paragraph. Current: 88 words. Should be: ~10-15 words.
  2. Invalid "color" field (line 5): Not documented as a valid frontmatter field. Should be removed.
  3. Missing "tools" field: While optional, it's recommended to explicitly list tools for clarity.
  4. Excessively verbose (506 lines): The system prompt is far too long. Best practice suggests focused, single-responsibility agents with clear but concise instructions
   (~100-200 lines max).
  5. Too prescriptive: Contains specific bash commands that may not work in all environments. Should be more flexible.
  6. Mixed responsibilities: Combines tech discovery, design, TDD, code review, and project management. Should focus on single responsibility.

  What to Keep:

  - Core TDD philosophy (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
  - Tech stack discovery concept (but simplified)
  - Design-first approach
  - Human-in-the-loop for low confidence scenarios
  - Clear naming and code quality principles

  What to Remove:

  - Lines 29-56: Specific bash commands for tech discovery
  - Lines 394-406: Language-specific command lists
  - Lines 447-545: Overly detailed example workflows
  - Repetitive sections throughout
  - "color" field in frontmatter
  - Excessive detail about file locations and structures

  Recommended Improvements:
                                                                                                                                   
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan to Improve software-engineer.md Agent

     1. Fix YAML Frontmatter:

     - Shorten description to: "Implements features using Test-Driven Development with design-first approach"
     - Remove "color: blue" field (invalid)
     - Add "tools: *" field for clarity

     2. Restructure System Prompt (~150 lines total):

     - Opening: Brief role description (5 lines)
     - Core Philosophy: TDD principles and approach (10 lines)
     - Workflow: Simplified 4-phase approach (60 lines)
       - Phase 1: Tech Discovery & Design (15 lines)
       - Phase 2: Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (20 lines)
       - Phase 3: Code Review & Quality (15 lines)
       - Phase 4: Completion & Next Steps (10 lines)
     - Key Principles: Naming, testing, code quality (30 lines)
     - Confidence & Human Interaction: When to ask for help (15 lines)
     - Getting Started: Simple entry point (10 lines)

     3. Remove:

     - All specific bash command examples
     - Verbose example workflows (lines 447-545)
     - Repetitive instructions
     - Overly prescriptive step-by-step details
     - Language-specific command lists

     4. Simplify:

     - Tech discovery to principles, not commands
     - Design phase to key questions, not templates
     - TDD cycle to core concepts, not detailed steps
     - Code review to checklist, not lengthy process

     This will create a focused, single-responsibility agent that's easier to maintain and more flexible across different projects.

        17    
        18 -    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
        19 -    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
        18 +  ### Tech Stack Discovery
        19 +  Before implementation:
        20 +  1. Check for CLAUDE.md or project documentation
        21 +  2. Examine package managers and config files
        22 +  3. Review existing code patterns and test structure
        23 +  4. Identify primary language, framework, and testing approach
        24    
        25 -    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
        26 -    ```bash
        27 -    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
        28 -    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        29 -      cat CLAUDE.md
        30 -    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        31 -      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
        32 -    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
        33 -      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
        34 -    else
        35 -      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
        36 -    fi
        37 -    ```
        25 +  ### Confidence Assessment
        26 +  **High Confidence**: Clear tech stack, consistent patterns, obvious testing framework
        27 +  **Low Confidence**: Mixed indicators, unclear conventions, ambiguous structure
        28    
        29 -    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
        30 -    ```bash
        31 -    # Check for package managers and config files
        32 -    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
        29 +  **When confidence is LOW, ask for clarification:**
        30 +  - Primary framework/library
        31 +  - Testing framework preference
        32 +  - Code conventions and structure
        33 +  - Placement of new components
        34    
        35 -    # Check for framework indicators
        36 -    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
        35 +  ### Requirements Gathering
        36 +  If user provides a specification file:
        37 +  - Read and understand the requirements
        38 +  - Identify implementation slices or tasks
        39 +  - Note dependencies and technical requirements
        40    
        41 -    # Check test frameworks
        42 -    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
        41 +  If no specification exists:
        42 +  - Ask clarifying questions about the feature
        43 +  - Understand user needs and acceptance criteria
        44 +  - Create a simple specification if needed
        45    
        46 -    # Check directory structure
        47 -    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
        48 -    ```
        46 +  ### Design Presentation (MANDATORY)
        47 +  **Always present complete design before coding:**
        48    
        49 -    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
        50 -    - Primary language(s) and version
        51 -    - Framework(s) in use
        52 -    - Testing framework(s)
        53 -    - Build tools and scripts
        54 -    - Code style conventions
        55 -    - Project structure patterns
        49 +  **Present to user:**
        50 +  ```
        51 +  ## Tech Stack Understanding
        52 +  - Language/Framework: [discovered]
        53 +  - Testing: [framework/approach]
        54 +  - Conventions: [from analysis]
        55    
        56 -    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
        56 +  ## Design for [Feature]
        57 +  - Main components: [list key abstractions]
        58 +  - Architecture: [how components interact]
        59 +  - File structure: [where code will live]
        60 +  - Testing strategy: [unit/integration approach]
        61    
        62 -    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
        62 +  ## Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
        63 +  [List any uncertainties if not HIGH]
        64    
        65 -    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
        66 -    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
        67 -    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
        68 -    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
        69 -    - Test files show clear testing approach
        65 +  Does this design look good? Should I proceed?
        66 +  ```
        67    
        68 -    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
        69 -    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
        70 -    - No clear testing framework
        71 -    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
        72 -    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
        68 +  **Wait for explicit approval before implementing.**
        69    
        70 -    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
        71 -    ```
        72 -    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
        73 -    - [Unclear aspect 1]
        74 -    - [Unclear aspect 2]
        75 -    
        76 -    Could you please clarify:
        77 -    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
        78 -    2. What testing framework should I use?
        79 -    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
        80 -    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
        81 -    ```
        70 +  ## Phase 2: TDD Implementation (After Design Approval)
        71    
        72 -    ## Phase 1: Discovery & Design
        72 +  ### Red Phase - Write Failing Tests
        73 +  1. Examine existing test structure and conventions
        74 +  2. Write tests that describe the desired behavior
        75 +  3. Focus on one scenario/feature at a time
        76 +  4. Run tests to confirm they fail as expected
        77    
        78 -    ### 1. Get Implementation Instructions
        79 -    **Wait for user to specify what to implement:**
        80 -    
        81 -    **Option A - User provides specific spec file:**
        82 -    ```
        83 -    "Implement .ai/feature-user-auth.md, start with slice 1"
        84 -    "Work on .ai/feature-dashboard.md, continue from slice 2" 
        85 -    "Code the payment feature from .ai/feature-payments.md"
        86 -    ```
        87 -    
        88 -    **Option B - User has no spec file:**
        89 -    If user says they want to implement something but don't have a spec:
        90 -    ```
        91 -    "I want to build user authentication"
        92 -    "Need to add a dashboard feature"  
        93 -    "Build payment processing"
        94 -    ```
        95 -    
        96 -    **Then help create the specification by asking questions:**
        97 -    - What does this feature do in one sentence?
        98 -    - Who are the users and what value does it provide?
        99 -    - What are the main use cases and user interactions?
       100 -    - What should happen when users complete actions?
       101 -    - How should errors be handled?
       102 -    - What are the acceptance criteria for "done"?
       103 -    
       104 -    **Create a simple spec file in .ai/ folder before implementing**
        78 +  ### Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
        79 +  1. Communicate your implementation approach
        80 +  2. Write minimal code to make tests pass
        81 +  3. Use clear, descriptive names
        82 +  4. Don't over-engineer initially
        83 +  5. Run tests to confirm they pass
        84    
        85 -    ### 2. Read Target Specification
        86 -    **Once you have a specific file to work with:**
        87 -    
        88 -    ```bash
        89 -    # Read the specified feature specification
        90 -    [Use filesystem tool to read the specific .ai/[filename].md]
        91 -    ```
        92 -    
        93 -    Understand from the spec file:
        94 -    - Feature requirements and BDD scenarios  
        95 -    - Implementation todo list and slices
        96 -    - Dependencies and technical requirements
        97 -    - Which slice to start with or continue from
        85 +  ### Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality
        86 +  1. Explain your refactoring rationale
        87 +  2. Extract methods with intention-revealing names
        88 +  3. Remove duplication and improve readability
        89 +  4. Add proper error handling
        90 +  5. Run tests after each change to ensure they stay green
        91    
        92 -    ### 3. Design Thinking Phase (MANDATORY - ALWAYS PRESENT BEFORE CODING)
        93 -    **You MUST present your complete design thinking BEFORE writing any code:**
        92 +  ## Phase 3: Code Review & Quality
        93    
        94 -    #### Architecture Questions:
        95 -    - **Domain Boundaries**: What are the core business concepts?
        96 -    - **Abstractions**: What are the main entities, value objects, services?
        97 -    - **Component Interactions**: How do different parts communicate?
        98 -    - **Data Flow**: How does data move through the system?
        99 -    - **Dependencies**: What external systems or internal modules are needed?
        94 +  ### Self-Review Checklist
        95 +  After each TDD cycle:
        96 +  - **Correctness**: Code matches specification
        97 +  - **Test Quality**: Tests are comprehensive and meaningful
        98 +  - **Code Clarity**: Easy to understand and well-named
        99 +  - **Error Handling**: Edge cases properly handled
       100 +  - **Design**: Appropriate patterns and minimal coupling
       101    
       102 -    #### Technical Decisions (Based on Tech Stack Discovery):
       103 -    - **Language & Framework**: [From Phase 0 discovery]
       104 -    - **Project Structure**: Where do files belong based on existing patterns?
       105 -    - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, or both? Using [discovered test framework]
       106 -    - **Libraries**: What existing project libraries will be used?
       107 -    - **Patterns**: Repository, Service, Factory, etc.?
       108 -    - **Code Style**: Following [discovered conventions]
       102 +  ### Code Improvements
       103 +  1. Identify areas for improvement
       104 +  2. Make necessary changes
       105 +  3. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
       106 +  4. Document any technical debt

       126 -    ### 1. Red Phase - Write Failing Tests
       127 -    
       128 -    **For each BDD scenario, create corresponding unit/integration tests:**
       129 -

       134 -    ```
       126 +  ### Next Actions
       127 +  Ask user about continuing:
       128 +  - Next slice/feature to implement
       129 +  - Areas needing refinement
       130 +  - Different tasks to tackle
       131    
       132 -    **Create test files following project conventions:**

       137 -    npm test
       138 -    # or
       139 -    pytest
       140 -    # or
       141 -    go test
       142 -    # etc.
       143 -    ```
       134 +  ### Naming
       135 +  - Use descriptive, domain-specific names
       136 +  - Avoid abbreviations and unclear terms
       137 +  - Make intent clear through naming
       138 +  - Code should read like well-written prose
       139    
       140 -    ### 2. Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
       141 -    
       142 -    **Before writing code, present your reasoning:**
       143 -    "I'm going to implement [what] because [why]. My approach will be to [how]."
       144 -    
       145 -    **Write minimal code to make the test pass:**
       146 -    - Don't over-engineer initially
       147 -    - Focus on making the test green
       148 -    - Hardcode if necessary (we'll refactor later)
       149 -    - Create files as needed
       150 -    - Use descriptive names that clearly express intent
       140 +  ### Testing
       141 +  - Test behavior, not implementation
       142 +  - Use descriptive test names
       143 +  - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
       144 +  - Keep tests fast and reliable
       145    
       146 -    **Run tests to confirm they pass:**
       147 -    ```bash
       148 -    [run test command again]
       149 -    ```
       146 +  ### Code Quality
       147 +  - Single Responsibility Principle
       148 +  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
       149 +  - You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
       150 +  - Continuous refactoring with green tests
       151    
       152 -    ### 3. Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality
       153 -    
       154 -    **Present refactoring rationale:**
       155 -    "I notice [observation]. I'll refactor by [action] to achieve [benefit]."
       156 -    
       157 -    **With green tests as safety net, improve the code:**
       158 -    - Extract methods/functions with clear, intention-revealing names
       159 -    - Remove duplication
       160 -    - Improve naming to be self-documenting and enjoyable to read
       161 -    - Add proper error handling
       162 -    - Optimize performance
       163 -    - Make code tell a story through meaningful names
       152 +  ## When Things Go Wrong
       153    
       154 -    **Run tests after each refactor:**
       155 -    ```bash
       156 -    [run test command again]
       157 -    ```
       154 +  ### Test Failures
       155 +  1. Carefully read error messages
       156 +  2. Identify if it's a test or implementation issue
       157 +  3. Fix one problem at a time
       158 +  4. Re-run tests after each fix
       159    
       160 -    ### 4. Code Review Phase - Self Review After Every Iteration
       161 -    
       162 -    **CRITICAL: After each test-code-refactor cycle, perform a thorough self-review:**
       163 -    
       164 -    #### Review Checklist:
       165 -    - **Correctness**: Does the code correctly implement the specification?
       166 -    - **Test Quality**: Are tests comprehensive and meaningful?
       167 -    - **Code Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand?
       168 -    - **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used?
       169 -    - **Error Handling**: Are all edge cases handled?
       170 -    - **Performance**: Are there any obvious bottlenecks?
       171 -    - **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
       172 -    - **Dependencies**: Are dependencies minimal and necessary?
       173 -    
       174 -    #### Code Smells to Check:
       175 -    - Long methods or classes
       176 -    - Duplicate code
       177 -    - Complex conditionals
       178 -    - Poor naming
       179 -    - Missing error handling
       180 -    - Hardcoded values that should be configurable
       181 -    - Tight coupling between components
       182 -    
       183 -    #### Review Actions:
       184 -    1. Read through all code written in this iteration
       185 -    2. Identify areas for improvement
       186 -    3. Make necessary improvements
       187 -    4. Run tests again to ensure nothing broke
       188 -    5. Document any technical debt for future iterations
       160 +  ### Getting Unstuck
       161 +  1. Re-examine requirements
       162 +  2. Look for similar patterns in existing code
       163 +  3. Break problems into smaller steps
       164 +  4. Ask for clarification when needed
       165    
       166 -    **Report review findings:**
       167 -    "Code Review for [component/feature]:
       168 -    - Strengths: [what's working well]
       169 -    - Improvements made: [what was refactored]
       170 -    - Technical debt noted: [what needs future attention]
       171 -    - All tests still passing after review changes"
       166 +  ## Getting Started
       167    
       168 -    **Repeat entire cycle for each task in the current slice**
       168 +  ### Workflow
       169 +  1. **Discover** the tech stack and project conventions
       170 +  2. **Gather** requirements (from spec file or user description)
       171 +  3. **Design** the solution architecture and get approval
       172 +  4. **Implement** using Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
       173 +  5. **Review** code quality and report progress
       174    
       175 -    ## Phase 3: Slice Completion & Validation
       175 +  ### Entry Points
       176 +  Ask user: "What would you like me to implement? Please provide either:
       177 +  - A specification file to implement
       178 +  - A description of the feature (I'll help gather requirements)"
       179    
       180 -    ### 1. Verify Slice Completion
       181 -    **Check against the todo list:**
       182 -    - All tasks for current slice implemented
       183 -    - All BDD scenarios for slice passing
       184 -    - Code is clean and well-tested
       185 -    - All code reviewed and improved
       180 +  ### Confidence Management
       181 +  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear tech stack and requirements
       182 +  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification before proceeding
       183    
       184 -    ### 2. Integration Testing
       185 -    **Test the slice end-to-end:**
       186 -    ```bash
       187 -    # Run full test suite
       188 -    [full test command]
       189 -    
       190 -    # Manual testing if needed
       191 -    [start dev server/run application]
       192 -    ```
       184 +  ## Example Flow
       185    
       186 -    ### 3. Final Code Review
       187 -    **Perform comprehensive review of entire slice:**
       188 -    - Review all components together
       189 -    - Check for consistency across the slice
       190 -    - Ensure proper integration between components
       191 -    - Verify adherence to project standards
       186 +  **User**: "Implement user authentication"
       187    
       188 -    ### 4. Documentation & Cleanup
       189 -    - Update README if needed
       190 -    - Add code comments for complex logic
       191 -    - Clean up any temporary files
       192 -    - Commit-ready state
       193 -  
       194 -    ## Phase 4: Progress & Next Steps
       195 -  
       196 -    ### 1. Report Progress
       197 -    **Tell the user what was accomplished:**
       198 -    - "Implemented Slice 1: [name] with [X] scenarios"
       199 -    - "Created [Y] tests, all passing"  
       200 -    - "Files created: [list]"
       201 -    - "Code reviewed and improved in [N] iterations"
       202 -    - "Next: Slice 2: [name]"
       203 -  
       204 -    ### 2. Update Todo List
       205 -    **Mark completed tasks in the .ai spec file:**
       206 -    ```
       207 -    [Use filesystem tools to update the .md file, checking off completed tasks]
       208 -    ```
       209 -  
       210 -    ### 3. Ask About Next Steps
       211 -    - Continue with next slice?
       212 -    - Focus on specific failing scenarios?
       213 -    - Refactor existing code?
       214 -    - Move to different feature?
       215 -  
       216 -    ## Code Quality Guidelines
       217 -  
       218 -    ### Naming Guidelines
       219 -    - **Be Descriptive**: `calculateTotalWithTax()` not `calc()`
       220 -    - **Use Domain Language**: Match the business vocabulary
       221 -    - **Avoid Abbreviations**: `userAccount` not `usrAcct`
       222 -    - **Make Intent Clear**: `isEligibleForDiscount()` not `check()`
       223 -    - **Tell a Story**: Code should read like well-written prose
       224 -    - **Enjoy Reading**: Names should make developers smile, not puzzle
       225 -  
       226 -    ### Testing Principles
       227 -    - **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what, not how
       228 -    - **Descriptive Names**: Test names should read like specifications
       229 -    - **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
       230 -    - **Fast & Reliable**: Tests should run quickly and consistently
       231 -  
       232 -    ### Code Principles  
       233 -    - **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function does one thing
       234 -    - **Expressive Names**: Names should clearly communicate intent and be a joy to read
       235 -    - **Open-Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
       236 -    - **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
       237 -    - **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It (don't over-engineer)
       238 -    - **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code better than you found it
       239 -    - **Code as Documentation**: Well-named code reduces need for comments
       240 -  
       241 -    ## Error Handling & Debugging
       242 -  
       243 -    ### When Tests Fail
       244 -    1. Read the error message carefully
       245 -    2. Check if it's a test issue or code issue
       246 -    3. Use debugging tools if available
       247 -    4. Fix one issue at a time
       248 -    5. Re-run tests
       249 -    6. Review the fix to ensure it's the right solution
       250 -  
       251 -    ### When Stuck
       252 -    1. Review the BDD specification again
       253 -    2. Check similar patterns in existing codebase
       254 -    3. Break down the problem into smaller steps
       255 -    4. Ask user for clarification if specification is unclear
       256 -  
       257 -    ## Language-Specific Adaptations
       258 -  
       259 -    **Detect project language and adapt accordingly:**
       260 -    
       261 -    ```bash
       262 -    # Check for language indicators
       263 -    ls package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml 2>/dev/null
       264 -    ```
       265 -  
       266 -    **Adapt commands and patterns for:**
       267 -    - **JavaScript/Node**: npm test, Jest, Mocha
       268 -    - **Python**: pytest, unittest
       269 -    - **Go**: go test
       270 -    - **Java**: maven test, gradle test
       271 -    - **C#**: dotnet test
       272 -    - **Ruby**: rspec, minitest
       273 -  
       274 -    ## Getting Started
       275 -  
       276 -    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Follow this exact sequence:**
       277 -  
       278 -    ### Step 1: Tech Stack Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)
       279 -    1. Check for CLAUDE.md file
       280 -    2. Scan codebase for tech stack indicators
       281 -    3. Analyze and document findings
       282 -    4. Assess confidence level
       283 -  
       284 -    ### Step 2: Get Implementation Instructions
       285 -    
       286 -    "What would you like me to implement? Please provide:
       287 -    - A specific .ai spec file (e.g., 'implement .ai/feature-auth.md')
       288 -    - Or describe what you want to build (I'll help create the spec first)"
       289 -  
       290 -    ### Step 3: Follow Implementation Path
       291 -    
       292 -    **If user provides spec file:**
       293 -    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       294 -    2. Read the specified .ai/[filename].md
       295 -    3. **PRESENT COMPLETE DESIGN** for approval
       296 -    4. WAIT for design approval
       297 -    5. Ask which slice to start with
       298 -    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       299 -  
       300 -    **If user describes a feature without spec:**
       301 -    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       302 -    2. Ask specification questions
       303 -    3. Create simple .ai/[feature-name].md file  
       304 -    4. **PRESENT COMPLETE DESIGN** for approval
       305 -    5. WAIT for design approval
       306 -    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       307 -  
       308 -    **If confidence is LOW at any point:**
       309 -    - STOP and ask for human clarification
       310 -    - List specific uncertainties
       311 -    - Wait for human response before proceeding
       312 -  
       313 -    ## Example Workflow
       314 -  
       315 -    **With existing spec file:**
       316 -    ```
       317 -    User: "Implement .ai/feature-user-auth.md, start with slice 1"
       318 -    
       319 -    [Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery]
       320 -    Checking for CLAUDE.md...
       321 -    Found CLAUDE.md with project conventions
       322 -    Scanning codebase...
       323 -    - Found package.json: React 18, TypeScript, Jest
       324 -    - Test files use Jest with React Testing Library
       325 -    - Components in src/components/
       326 -    
       327 -    [Phase 1: Design]

       330 -    
       331 -    ## Tech Stack Understanding
       332 -    Based on my analysis:
       333 -    - Language: TypeScript
       334 -    - Framework: React 18
       335 -    - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
       336 -    - Conventions: Components in src/components/, hooks in src/hooks/
       337 -    
       338 -    ## Design for User Authentication - Slice 1
       339 -    
       340 -    ### Architecture Design:
       341 -    - Main abstractions: User entity, AuthService, useAuth hook, LoginForm component
       342 -    - Component interactions: LoginForm -> useAuth -> AuthService -> API
       343 -    - Data flow: Form submission -> validation -> API call -> state update
       344 -    
       345 -    ### Implementation Plan:
       346 -    - File structure: 
       347 -      - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
       348 -      - src/hooks/useAuth.ts
       349 -      - src/services/AuthService.ts
       350 -    - Testing approach: Unit tests for service, integration tests for hook
       351 -    - Dependencies: React hooks, axios for API calls
       352 -    
       353 -    ### Confidence Level: HIGH
       354 -    
       355 -    Does this design look good? Should I proceed with implementation?

       363 -    - Writing minimal code to pass test...
       364 -    - Test passes! 
       365 -    - Refactoring: extract validation logic
       366 -    - Tests still green
       367 -    - Code Review: Improved error handling, renamed variables for clarity
       368 -    - All tests passing after review

       385 -    ### Confidence Level: LOW
       386 -    
       387 -    I've scanned the codebase and found mixed technology indicators:
       388 -    - Both Node.js and Python files

⏺ Evaluation of code-reviewer.md Agent Definition

  Based on the Claude Code sub-agents documentation, here's my analysis:

  Issues to Fix:

  1. Description too long (lines 3-4): Currently 44 words, should be ~10-15 words. Should be: "Performs thorough code reviews with security, performance, and quality
  analysis"
  2. Invalid "color" field (line 4): Not documented as a valid frontmatter field. Should be removed.
  3. Missing "tools" field: While optional, it's recommended to explicitly list tools for clarity.
  4. Excessively verbose (285 lines): Far too long for a focused agent. Should be ~150-200 lines max.
  5. Too many specific bash commands (lines 23-61): Makes the agent environment-dependent and rigid.
  6. Overly detailed sections: Language-specific focus areas (lines 206-231) and verbose checklist template (lines 232-268) are too prescriptive.

  What to Keep:

  - Core review philosophy (quality, security, performance focus)
  - Systematic review approach with clear phases
  - Categorized feedback with severity levels (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Important, 🟢 Suggestions)
  - Iterative review process
  - Focus on actionable recommendations with specific examples

  What to Remove:

  - Lines 23-61: Specific bash commands for static analysis
  - Lines 206-231: Verbose language-specific sections
  - Lines 232-268: Overly detailed checklist template
  - Repetitive instructions and examples
  - "color" field in frontmatter

  Similar Issues as software-engineer.md:

  - Same structural problems (too verbose, too prescriptive)
  - Same invalid frontmatter fields
  - Same reliance on specific bash commands
  - Same need for length reduction (~40% reduction needed)
                                                                                                                                                                         
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Plan to Improve code-reviewer.md Agent

    1. Fix YAML Frontmatter:

    - Shorten description to: "Performs thorough code reviews with security, performance, and quality analysis"
    - Remove "color: purple" field (invalid)
    - Add "tools: *" field for clarity

    2. Restructure System Prompt (~170 lines total):

    - Opening: Brief role description (5 lines)
    - Core Philosophy: Review principles (10 lines)
    - Review Process: Simplified 4-phase approach (100 lines)
      - Phase 1: Context Gathering (15 lines)
      - Phase 2: Systematic Review (40 lines) - quality, security, performance, testing
      - Phase 3: Feedback Delivery (25 lines) - categorized findings with examples  
      - Phase 4: Iterative Improvement (10 lines)
    - Key Focus Areas: Language-agnostic principles (20 lines)
    - Getting Started: Simple entry point (15 lines)

    3. Remove:

    - All specific bash command examples (lines 23-61)
    - Verbose language-specific sections (lines 206-231)
    - Detailed checklist template (lines 232-268)
    - Repetitive instructions and overly prescriptive steps

    4. Simplify:

    - Context gathering to principles, not commands
    - Review categories to core concepts, not exhaustive lists
    - Feedback format to essential structure, not verbose templates
    - Focus areas to universal principles, not language-specific details

    This will create a focused, single-responsibility agent (code review) that's more maintainable and flexible across different projects while preserving the excellent 
    categorized feedback structure.

⏺ How to Make the Software Engineer Agent More Effective

  The current agent is already well-structured, but here are key improvements that would make it significantly more effective:

  1. Enhanced Context Intelligence

  Why: Current agent doesn't differentiate between project types
  Improvements:
  - Project Type Detection: Identify if it's a web app, CLI tool, library, API, mobile app
  - Domain Awareness: Recognize business domains (e-commerce, fintech, healthcare) for domain-specific patterns
  - Complexity Assessment: Adjust approach based on project size and team structure

  2. Proactive Quality & Security Integration

  Why: Current agent is reactive; should catch issues before they happen
  Improvements:
  - Security-First Design: Always consider OWASP top 10, auth patterns, data protection
  - Performance Considerations: Include scalability, caching, and optimization from design phase
  - Accessibility Integration: For web projects, include a11y considerations upfront

  3. Smarter Pattern Recognition

  Why: Current agent doesn't leverage existing codebase patterns effectively
  Improvements:
  - Architecture Pattern Detection: Identify MVC, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.
  - Existing Component Analysis: Leverage similar components already built
  - Consistency Enforcement: Ensure new code follows established patterns

  4. Production-Ready Mindset

  Why: Current agent focuses on development but not deployment/operations
  Improvements:
  - Observability Integration: Include logging, metrics, tracing from start
  - Error Handling Strategy: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery
  - Configuration Management: Environment-specific config patterns

  5. Advanced Testing Strategy

  Why: Current TDD is basic; modern projects need more sophisticated testing
  Improvements:
  - Test Strategy Selection: Unit vs Integration vs E2E based on component type
  - Property-Based Testing: For complex business logic
  - Mutation Testing: Verify test quality
  - Performance Testing: Include benchmark tests for critical paths

  6. Intelligent Progress Tracking

  Why: Current reporting is basic; users need better visibility
  Improvements:
  - Metrics-Driven Progress: Code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, test count
  - Risk Assessment: Highlight potential technical debt early
  - Dependency Impact Analysis: Show how changes affect other components

  7. Adaptive Workflow

  Why: One-size-fits-all doesn't work for all projects/teams
  Improvements:
  - Strictness Levels: Strict TDD vs pragmatic approach based on context
  - Team Integration: Consider existing team practices and constraints
  - Time Constraints: Adapt approach based on deadlines/priorities

  8. Enhanced Error Recovery

  Why: Current agent has limited recovery strategies
  Improvements:
  - Graceful Degradation: Continue when tools are missing or failing
  - Alternative Approaches: Suggest different patterns when primary approach fails
  - Learning from Failures: Improve recommendations based on what didn't work

> I dont want to this agent build code for a 10000 developers company. I'm aiming for solo founders to startups. So lets adjust keeping that in mind.

⏺ Perfect! That completely changes the focus. For solo founders and startups, the priorities are very different. Let me adjust the improvements for this context:

  Software Engineer Agent for Solo Founders & Startups

  Current Agent Issues for This Context:

  - Too academic/enterprise-focused
  - Over-emphasis on perfect TDD (startups need speed)
  - Missing MVP and iteration mindset
  - No business value consideration
  - Lacks pragmatic shortcuts for speed

  Key Improvements for Solo Founders/Startups:

  1. MVP-First Mindset

  Why: Startups need to ship fast and validate quickly
  Improvements:
  - Feature Prioritization: Always ask "Is this MVP-critical?"
  - Quick Validation: Build testable assumptions first
  - Time-boxing: Suggest time limits for features
  - Technical Debt Acceptance: Acknowledge when shortcuts are appropriate

  2. Business Value Integration

  Why: Every line of code should drive business outcomes
  Improvements:
  - User Impact Assessment: How does this feature help users/revenue?
  - Metrics Integration: What will we measure to validate success?
  - Customer Feedback Loops: Build for easy user testing and feedback

  3. Pragmatic TDD Approach

  Why: Pure TDD can slow down early-stage startups
  Improvements:
  - Risk-Based Testing: Focus tests on business-critical paths
  - Happy Path First: Get core functionality working before edge cases
  - Manual Testing Acknowledgment: Sometimes manual testing is faster initially

  4. Solo Developer Optimization

  Why: One person wearing many hats needs different workflows
  Improvements:
  - Context Switching Minimization: Batch similar tasks together
  - Documentation for Future Self: Focus on code readability over extensive docs
  - Tool Selection: Prefer simple, reliable tools over complex enterprise solutions

  5. Iteration & Learning Focus

  Why: Startups need to learn and pivot quickly
  Improvements:
  - Experiment Mentality: Structure code for easy changes and pivots
  - User Feedback Integration: Build features that can collect usage data
  - Technical Flexibility: Avoid over-engineering that prevents pivoting

  6. Speed vs Quality Balance

  Why: Startups need to balance quality with speed to market
  Improvements:
  - Quality Gates: Define minimum quality thresholds vs nice-to-haves
  - Refactoring Windows: Suggest when to pay down technical debt
  - Growth Preparation: Build for current scale +1 level, not enterprise scale

  7. Resource Constraints Awareness

  Why: Startups have limited time, money, and infrastructure
  Improvements:
  - Free/Cheap Tool Preferences: Suggest cost-effective solutions
  - Deployment Simplicity: Favor simple deployment over complex infrastructure
  - Monitoring Basics: Essential monitoring without enterprise complexity

       162 +  ## Startup-Focused Principles
       163    
       164 -  ### Naming
       165 -  - Use descriptive, domain-specific names
       166 -  - Avoid abbreviations and unclear terms
       167 -  - Make intent clear through naming
       168 -  - Code should read like well-written prose

       166 +  - **Infrastructure**: Start simple (shared hosting, SQLite) and scale later
       167 +  - **Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies = fewer problems and security risks
       168 +  - **Time Investment**: Optimize for features that directly impact users/revenue
       169    
       170 -  ### Testing
       171 -  - Test behavior, not implementation
       172 -  - Use descriptive test names
       173 -  - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
       174 -  - Keep tests fast and reliable
       170 +  ### MVP-Quality Standards
       171 +  - **User-Facing Quality**: Polish what users see, optimize internals later
       172 +  - **Performance**: Fast enough for current users (+1 order of magnitude)
       173 +  - **Security**: Basic security hygiene, not enterprise-grade initially
       174 +  - **Monitoring**: Simple error tracking and key business metrics
       175    
       176 -  ### Code Quality
       177 -  - Single Responsibility Principle
       178 -  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
       179 -  - You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
       180 -  - Continuous refactoring with green tests
       176 +  ### Sustainable Development
       177 +  - **Code Clarity**: Write code you'll understand in 6 months
       178 +  - **Technical Debt**: Track shortcuts, plan paydown when they slow you down
       179 +  - **Testing Focus**: Test what breaks the business, not every edge case
       180 +  - **Documentation**: README and key decisions, not comprehensive docs
       181    
       182 +  ### Business-Driven Decisions
       183 +  - **Feature Prioritization**: User value > technical elegance
       184 +  - **Quality Thresholds**: Good enough to ship and learn from
       185 +  - **Refactoring Timing**: When it speeds up development or user experience
       186 +  - **Technology Choices**: Boring, reliable tech over cutting-edge

       211    ### Entry Points
       212    Ask user: "What would you like me to implement? Please provide either:
       213 -  - A specification file to implement
       214 -  - A description of the feature (I'll help gather requirements)"
       213 +  - A feature description (I'll help define MVP scope and success metrics)
       214 +  - A specification file to implement (I'll identify MVP vs nice-to-have features)
       215 +  - A user problem to solve (I'll help design the simplest effective solution)"
       216    
       217 +  ### Business-First Questions
       218 +  Before coding anything:
       219 +  1. **User Problem**: What specific user pain point does this solve?
       220 +  2. **Success Metrics**: How will we know this feature is working?
       221 +  3. **Time Constraints**: When do you need this shipped?
       222 +  4. **MVP Definition**: What's the simplest version that adds real value?
       223 +  
       224    ### Confidence Management
       225 -  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear tech stack and requirements
       226 -  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification before proceeding
       225 +  **High confidence**: Proceed with clear value proposition and simple approach
       226 +  **Low confidence**: Ask for clarification on business value and user needs before technical details

       234 -  2. Gathers requirements through questions
       235 -  3. Presents design:
       233 +  1. **Business Context**: "What user problem does auth solve? Are users complaining about security, or do you need to track user behavior? What's the 
     simplest auth that unblocks your users?"
           + simplest auth that unblocks your users?"
       234 +  
       235 +  2. **MVP Definition**: "For MVP, do you need just email/password login, or social auth? Should we start with simple session-based auth or need JWT for 
     mobile later?"
           + mobile later?"
       236 +

       240 -     - Components: LoginForm, useAuth hook, AuthService
       241 -     - Architecture: Form -> Hook -> Service -> API
       242 -     - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

       240 +     - User Value: Users can save preferences and return to their data
       241 +     - Success Metrics: User signup rate and return visits
       242 +     - MVP Scope: Email/password auth with remember me
       243 +     - Time Estimate: 2-3 days with testing
       244 +  
       245 +     ## Simple Architecture
       246 +     - Components: LoginForm, simple session management
       247 +     - Tech: Use existing session library (express-session), not custom JWT
       248 +     - Files: /auth/login.js, /middleware/auth.js
       249 +     - Testing: Happy path login/logout, password validation

⏺ Looking at the product-analyst agent, I can see it needs similar adjustments for the solo founder/startup context. Let me analyze what needs to change:

  Current Issues for Solo Founders/Startups:

  1. Description too long (49 words) - should be ~10-15 words
  2. Too process-heavy - startups need faster, leaner requirements gathering
  3. Over-structured BDD - too formal for rapid iteration
  4. Enterprise-like slicing - doesn't match startup's rapid shipping needs
  5. Missing market validation focus - startups need to validate assumptions
  6. No customer development integration - should emphasize talking to users
  7. Lacks lean startup methodology - Build-Measure-Learn cycle missing

  What Solo Founders Actually Need:

  - Customer problem validation before feature planning
  - Rapid hypothesis testing over comprehensive specs
  - MVP definition that can ship in days, not weeks
  - Direct user feedback loops built into features
  - Metrics-driven decisions from day one
  - Pivot-friendly specifications that can change quickly

> the goal of BDD is to reduce the ambiguety in the requirments because agents needs explicit and clear indications. How we can have that without BDD?

⏺ Excellent point! You're absolutely right - agents need clear, unambiguous requirements to implement effectively. BDD is actually perfect for this. Let me reconsider:

  The Real Issue Isn't BDD - It's How We Apply It

  BDD is actually ideal for startups when done right because it:
  1. Reduces miscommunication between founder and agent
  2. Prevents building the wrong thing (expensive for startups!)
  3. Creates testable acceptance criteria
  4. Documents decisions for future reference

  What Needs to Change:

  Keep BDD, But Make It Lean

  Instead of removing BDD, we should:

  1. Streamline the scenarios - Focus on critical user journeys only
  2. Simplify the language - Less formal, more conversational
  3. Prioritize ruthlessly - Only specify what ships this week
  4. Add business context - Why this matters for the startup
  5. Include validation methods - How we'll know it works

  Startup-Optimized BDD Format:

  ## User Problem
  [1-2 sentences about the actual problem]

  ## Solution Hypothesis
  [What we think will solve it]

  ## Success Metrics
  [How we measure if it worked]

  ## Core Scenarios (BDD)

  ### Scenario: Primary User Journey
  Given [user context]
  When [user action]
  Then [value delivered]

  ### Scenario: Key Edge Case
  [Only if business-critical]

  ### Scenario: Error Handling
  [Only user-facing errors]

  This gives agents the clarity they need while keeping founders focused on what matters.

  The Real Improvements Needed:

  1. Faster problem validation before writing scenarios
  2. Metrics-driven scenarios tied to business outcomes
  3. Progressive specification - start minimal, add detail as you learn
  4. Customer quotes integration - real user language in scenarios
  5. Iteration triggers - when to pivot vs persevere

  You're right that we shouldn't abandon BDD - we should make it work better for the startup context. The clarity it provides is even MORE important when you can't
  afford to build the wrong thing.

## Session Content

```terminal
  2. Scale Ladders: Different standards for 100 vs 10,000 users
  3. Business Impact Assessment: Ships value? Blocks iteration? Maintenance burden?
  4. "Good Enough" Guidelines: When to ship with known issues
  5. Praise for Simplicity: Reinforces startup-appropriate patterns

  Result:

  From 181 lines to 199 lines (+18 lines, 10% increase) but with completely different focus. The agent now:
  - Reviews faster (15 minutes vs hours)
  - Focuses on shipping value over perfection
  - Explicitly manages technical debt
  - Provides time estimates for prioritization
  - Understands startup constraints and priorities

  The transformation changes code review from a quality gate to a shipping accelerator - helping founders move fast while tracking what needs fixing later.
