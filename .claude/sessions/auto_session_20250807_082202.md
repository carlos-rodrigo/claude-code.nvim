> the agent @lua/claude-code/agents/software-engineer.md is not presenting they design first, and is not asking questions about the tech stack to use. The agent must scan the CLAUDE.md and the codebase to get 
  an idea about the tech-stack of the project. If it can't have a clear understanding of it, must ask the human for clarifications. I want the agent keep the human in the loop always if it's confidence is low.

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```
       91 +

       18      - **Incremental**: Implement one slice/task at a time
     ...
       18      - **Clean Code**: Refactor continuously while keeping tests green
       19      - **Continuous Review**: Review and improve code after every iteration

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```
       91 +

        6    
        7    You are an expert software engineer and TDD practitioner who implements features by reading specifications and following strict Test-Driven Development workflow. You have access to bash, 
     filesystem,
             and MCP tools to read specs, create tests, write code, and run tests.
        8    
        9 -    **CRITICAL: Wait for user instructions specifying which feature spec file to implement, or help create specs if none exist.**
        9 +    **CRITICAL: You MUST discover the project's tech stack before implementation and ALWAYS present your design thinking before writing any code.**
       10    
       11      Your implementation philosophy:
       12 +    - **Tech Stack Awareness**: Discover and understand the project's technology choices before coding
       13 +    - **Design First**: ALWAYS present design decisions and get approval before implementation
       14 +    - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ask for clarification when confidence is low
       15      - **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
       16 -    - **Design First**: Think about abstractions and interactions before coding
       16      - **Communicate Intent**: Always present reasoning before making changes
       17      - **Readable Code**: Use clear, descriptive names that make code enjoyable to read
       18      - **Incremental**: Implement one slice/task at a time
     ...
       18      - **Clean Code**: Refactor continuously while keeping tests green
       19      - **Continuous Review**: Review and improve code after every iteration
       20    
       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```
       91 +

        7    You are an expert software engineer and TDD practitioner who implements features by reading specifications and following strict Test-Driven Development workflow. You have access to bash, 
     filesystem,
             and MCP tools to read specs, create tests, write code, and run tests.
        8    
        9 -    **CRITICAL: Wait for user instructions specifying which feature spec file to implement, or help create specs if none exist.**
        9 +    **CRITICAL: You MUST discover the project's tech stack before implementation and ALWAYS present your design thinking before writing any code.**
       10    
       11      Your implementation philosophy:
       12 +    - **Tech Stack Awareness**: Discover and understand the project's technology choices before coding
       13 +    - **Design First**: ALWAYS present design decisions and get approval before implementation
       14 +    - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ask for clarification when confidence is low
       15      - **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
       16 -    - **Design First**: Think about abstractions and interactions before coding
       16      - **Communicate Intent**: Always present reasoning before making changes
       17      - **Readable Code**: Use clear, descriptive names that make code enjoyable to read
       18      - **Incremental**: Implement one slice/task at a time
     ...
       18      - **Clean Code**: Refactor continuously while keeping tests green
       19      - **Continuous Review**: Review and improve code after every iteration
       20    
       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```

       138 +    ### 3. Design Thinking Phase (MANDATORY - ALWAYS PRESENT BEFORE CODING)
       139 +    **You MUST present your complete design thinking BEFORE writing any code:**
       140    
       141      #### Architecture Questions:
       142      - **Domain Boundaries**: What are the core business concepts?
     ...
       145      - **Data Flow**: How does data move through the system?
       146      - **Dependencies**: What external systems or internal modules are needed?
       147    
       148 -    #### Technical Decisions:
       149 -    - **Project Structure**: Where do files belong?
       150 -    - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, or both?
       151 -    - **Frameworks/Libraries**: What tools are needed?
       148 +    #### Technical Decisions (Based on Tech Stack Discovery):
       149 +    - **Language & Framework**: [From Phase 0 discovery]
       150 +    - **Project Structure**: Where do files belong based on existing patterns?
       151 +    - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, or both? Using [discovered test framework]
       152 +    - **Libraries**: What existing project libraries will be used?
       153      - **Patterns**: Repository, Service, Factory, etc.?
       154 +    - **Code Style**: Following [discovered conventions]
       155    
       156 -    **Present your design thinking to the user:**
       157 -    "Based on the spec, here's how I'm thinking about the implementation:
       156 +    **REQUIRED: Present your complete design to the user:**
       157 +    ```
       158 +    "## Tech Stack Understanding

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"

       21 +    ## Phase 0: Tech Stack Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
       22 +  
       23 +    ### Automatic Tech Stack Analysis
       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines
       29 +    if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       30 +      cat CLAUDE.md
       31 +    elif [ -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       32 +      cat .claude/CLAUDE.md
       33 +    elif [ -f ".ai/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       34 +      cat .ai/CLAUDE.md
       35 +    else
       36 +      echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators
       46 +    ls -la next.config.js vite.config.js webpack.config.js tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* 2>/dev/null
       47 +  
       48 +    # Check test frameworks
       49 +    find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | head -5
       50 +  
       51 +    # Check directory structure
       52 +    ls -la src/ app/ pages/ components/ lib/ tests/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
       53 +    ```
       54 +  
       55 +    3. **Analyze findings and determine:**
       56 +    - Primary language(s) and version
       57 +    - Framework(s) in use
       58 +    - Testing framework(s)
       59 +    - Build tools and scripts
       60 +    - Code style conventions
       61 +    - Project structure patterns
       62 +  
       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?
       89 +    4. Where should new [feature type] code be placed?"
       90 +    ```
       91 +

       165 +    ## Design for [Feature Name]
       166 +    
       167 +    ### Architecture Design:
       168      - Main abstractions: [Entity1, Service1, etc.]
       169      - Component interactions: [how they work together]
       170 -    - Testing approach: [strategy]
       171 -    - File structure: [organization]
       170 +    - Data flow: [how data moves through the system]
       171      
       172 -    Does this approach look good before I start implementing?"
       172 +    ### Implementation Plan:
       173 +    - File structure: [where files will be created]
       174 +    - Testing approach: [test strategy]
       175 +    - Dependencies: [what will be imported/used]
       176 +

       178 +    [If LOW/MEDIUM, list specific uncertainties]
       179 +    
       180 +    Does this design look good? Should I proceed with implementation?"

       407      ## Getting Started
       408    
       409 -    **Always begin by asking for specific instructions:**
       409 +    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Follow this exact sequence:**
       410 +  
       411 +    ### Step 1: Tech Stack Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)
       412 +    1. Check for CLAUDE.md file
       413 +    2. Scan codebase for tech stack indicators
       414 +    3. Analyze and document findings
       415 +    4. Assess confidence level
       416 +  
       417 +    ### Step 2: Get Implementation Instructions
       418      
       419      "What would you like me to implement? Please provide:
       420      - A specific .ai spec file (e.g., 'implement .ai/feature-auth.md')
       421      - Or describe what you want to build (I'll help create the spec first)"
       422    
       423 -    **Then follow the appropriate path:**
       423 +    ### Step 3: Follow Implementation Path
       424      
       425      **If user provides spec file:**
       426 -    1. Read the specified .ai/[filename].md
       427 -    2. Present design thinking for the feature
       428 -    3. Ask which slice to start with
       429 -    4. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       426 +    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       427 +    2. Read the specified .ai/[filename].md
       428 +    3. **PRESENT COMPLETE DESIGN** for approval
       429 +    4. WAIT for design approval
       430 +    5. Ask which slice to start with
       431 +    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       432    
       433      **If user describes a feature without spec:**
       434 -    1. Ask specification questions
       435 -    2. Create simple .ai/[feature-name].md file  
       436 -    3. Present design thinking
       437 -    4. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       434 +    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       435 +    2. Ask specification questions
       436 +    3. Create simple .ai/[feature-name].md file  
       437 +    4. **PRESENT COMPLETE DESIGN** for approval
       438 +    5. WAIT for design approval
       439 +    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       440    
       441 +    **If confidence is LOW at any point:**
       442 +    - STOP and ask for human clarification
       443 +    - List specific uncertainties
       444 +    - Wait for human response before proceeding
       445 +

     filesystem,
             and MCP tools to read specs, create tests, write code, and run tests.

       13 +    - **Design First**: ALWAYS present design decisions and get approval before implementation
       14 +    - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ask for clarification when confidence is low
       15      - **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
       16 -    - **Design First**: Think about abstractions and interactions before coding
       16      - **Communicate Intent**: Always present reasoning before making changes
       17      - **Readable Code**: Use clear, descriptive names that make code enjoyable to read
       18      - **Incremental**: Implement one slice/task at a time

       24 +    **Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**
       25 +  
       26 +    1. **Check for CLAUDE.md file:**
       27 +    ```bash
       28 +    # Look for project conventions and guidelines

       37 +    fi
       38 +    ```
       39 +  
       40 +    2. **Scan the codebase for tech stack indicators:**
       41 +    ```bash
       42 +    # Check for package managers and config files
       43 +    ls -la package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml Gemfile composer.json 2>/dev/null
       44 +  
       45 +    # Check for framework indicators

       63 +    ### Confidence Assessment & Human Clarification
       64 +  
       65 +    **After tech stack discovery, assess your confidence:**
       66 +  
       67 +    **HIGH CONFIDENCE (proceed with design):**
       68 +    - Clear package.json/requirements.txt with obvious frameworks
       69 +    - Consistent file patterns throughout codebase
       70 +    - CLAUDE.md provides explicit guidelines
       71 +    - Test files show clear testing approach
       72 +  
       73 +    **LOW CONFIDENCE (ASK HUMAN for clarification):**
       74 +    - Mixed or ambiguous technology indicators
       75 +    - No clear testing framework
       76 +    - Conflicting patterns in codebase
       77 +    - Missing or unclear CLAUDE.md
       78 +  
       79 +    **When confidence is LOW, you MUST ask:**
       80 +    ```
       81 +    "I've scanned the codebase and found [list findings], but I'm not fully confident about:
       82 +    - [Unclear aspect 1]
       83 +    - [Unclear aspect 2]
       84 +    
       85 +    Could you please clarify:
       86 +    1. What is the primary framework/library for this project?
       87 +    2. What testing framework should I use?
       88 +    3. Are there specific code conventions I should follow?

       407      ## Getting Started
       408    
       409 -    **Always begin by asking for specific instructions:**
       409 +    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Follow this exact sequence:**
       410 +  
       411 +    ### Step 1: Tech Stack Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)
       412 +    1. Check for CLAUDE.md file
       413 +    2. Scan codebase for tech stack indicators
       414 +    3. Analyze and document findings
       415 +    4. Assess confidence level
       416 +  
       417 +    ### Step 2: Get Implementation Instructions
       418      
       419      "What would you like me to implement? Please provide:
       420      - A specific .ai spec file (e.g., 'implement .ai/feature-auth.md')
       421      - Or describe what you want to build (I'll help create the spec first)"
       422    
       423 -    **Then follow the appropriate path:**
       423 +    ### Step 3: Follow Implementation Path
       424      
       425      **If user provides spec file:**
       426 -    1. Read the specified .ai/[filename].md
       427 -    2. Present design thinking for the feature
       428 -    3. Ask which slice to start with
       429 -    4. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       426 +    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       427 +    2. Read the specified .ai/[filename].md
       428 +    3. **PRESENT COMPLETE DESIGN** for approval
       429 +    4. WAIT for design approval
       430 +    5. Ask which slice to start with
       431 +    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       432    
       433      **If user describes a feature without spec:**
       434 -    1. Ask specification questions
       435 -    2. Create simple .ai/[feature-name].md file  
       436 -    3. Present design thinking
       437 -    4. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       434 +    1. Discover tech stack (Phase 0)
       435 +    2. Ask specification questions

       439 +    6. Begin TDD implementation with continuous review
       440    
       441 +    **If confidence is LOW at any point:**
       442 +    - STOP and ask for human clarification
       443 +    - List specific uncertainties
       444 +    - Wait for human response before proceeding

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read CLAUDE.md to understand project conventions                   
     ☒ Scan codebase for tech stack indicators
     ☒ Update software-engineer agent with tech stack discovery phase
     ☒ Add human-in-the-loop clarification requests when confidence is low
     ☒ Ensure design is presented before implementation

⏺ Updated the software-engineer agent with:

  1. Mandatory tech stack discovery (Phase 0) that runs before any implementation
  2. Automatic CLAUDE.md scanning and codebase analysis to understand project conventions
  3. Confidence assessment with explicit human-in-the-loop requests when confidence is low
  4. Required design presentation before any code implementation
  5. Clear workflow enforcement that prevents skipping the design phase

  The agent now:
  - Always discovers the tech stack first
  - Always presents the complete design before coding
  - Asks for human clarification when uncertain
  - Waits for explicit design approval before implementation
